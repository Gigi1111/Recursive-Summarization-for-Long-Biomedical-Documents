400 kcal energy and could provide 5 - 10 g of protein / day . nowadays , school nutrition programs are running as the national programs , world - wide . national school lunch program in the united states \\n there are also some reports regarding school feeding programs in developing countries . in vietnam , \\n school base program showed an improvement in nutrient intakes . in iran a national free food program ( nffp ) \\n is implemented in elementary schools of deprived areas to cover all poor students . however , this program is not conducted in slums and poor areas of the big cities so many malnourished children with low socio - economic situation are not covered by nffp . although the rate of poverty in areas known as deprived is higher than other areas , many students in deprived areas are not actually poor and can afford food . \\n hence , nutritional value of the nffp is lower than the scientific recommended snacks for this age group . \\n furthermore , lack of variety of food packages has decreased the tendency of children toward nffp . on the other hand , \\n the most important one is ministry of education ( moe ) of iran , which is responsible for selecting and providing the packages for targeted schools . \\n the ministry of health ( moh ) is supervising the health situation of students and their health needs . \\n welfare organizations , along with charities , have the indirect effect on nutritional status of students by financial support of their family . \\n provincial governors have also the role of coordinating and supervising all activities of these organizations . \\n parent - teacher association is a community - based institution that participates in school 's policy such as nffp . \\n in addition to these organizations , nutritional literacy of students , their parents and teachers , is a very important issue , which could affect nutritional status of school age children . \\n therefore , the present study was conducted with the aim of improving the nffp , so that by its resources all poor children will be covered even in big cities . \\n moreover , all food packages were replaced by nutritious and diverse packages that were accessible for non - poor children . according to the aim of this study and multiple factors that could affect the problem , \\n public health advocacy has been chosen as the best strategy to deal with this issue . \\n therefore , the present study determines the effects of nutrition intervention in an advocacy process model on the prevalence of underweight in school aged children in the poor area of shiraz , iran . \\n this interventional study has been carried out between 2009 and 2010 in shiraz , iran . \\n this survey was approved by the research committee of shiraz university of medical sciences . in coordination with education organization of fars province \\n two elementary schools and one middle school in the third region of the urban area of shiraz were selected randomly . in those schools all \\n students ( 2897 , 7 -

welfare is 19.3 ( or = 19.3 , ci = 2.5 - 3.9 , p = 0.04 ) . \\n the result of this community intervention study revealed that nutrition intervention based on advocacy program had been successful to reduce the prevalence of underweight among poor girls . \\n this study shows determinant factor of nutritional status of school age children was their socio - economic level . according to our knowledge , \\n this is the first study , which determines the effect of a community intervention based on advocacy process on the malnutrition indices in a big city ( shiraz ) in iran . \\n the other program in iran ( nffp ) is specified to deprived area and is not conducted in big cities . \\n allocating millions of dollars to nffp by government , selecting the malnourished students through an active screening system at primary and middle schools , paying attention of policy makers to student 's nutrition have provided the opportunity to combat the problem . however , negligence of under - poverty line , providing poor snacks in terms of nutritional value and lack of variety are the main defects of this program . \\n advocacy by definition is a blending of science , ethics and politics for comprehensive approaching health issues . by using advocacy program in california among the high school students for improving their nutrition and physical activity \\n angeles unified school district participants emphasized on nutrition classes for families as well as students in addition to other interventions . in the present study \\n another study revealed that evaluability assessment gave stakeholders the opportunity to reflect on the project and its implementation issues . \\n it seems that in iran , free food program among the students not only is needed in deprived areas , but also it should be performed in big cities such as shiraz . at baseline , \\n no significant difference was founded among wealthy students between the pre- and post - nutritional status intervention . \\n in contrast , the numbers of students who have malnutrition decreased from 44% to 39.4% , which was identified as a significant among impecunious girls students . \\n there was also a significant increase in the proportion of children with bmi that was normal for age ( 2 to + 1 sd ) most of the published community interventions showed better results among females compared with males . \\n this difference in the impact of nutritional interventions between male and female might be related to the different age of puberty in the female population compared to the male population . in the age range of the present study female \\n although , there is no nffp in big cities of iran , there are some programs for improving the nutritional status such as providing free milk in schools . \\n a recent publication has shown that school feeding programs focus on milk supplementation had beneficial effects on the physical function and school performances specifically among girls in iran . \\n the results of the mentioned study showed an improvement in the weight of children , psychological test 's scores and the grade - point average following this school feeding program . \\n the intervention in the present study had focused on the snack intake in the school time . \\n there are some reports regarding the nutrition transition in iran , which shows the importance of nutrition intervention to provide more healthy eating dietary habits among welfare groups of adolescents . \\n hence , nutrition intervention especially in the form of nutrition education is needed in big cities and among welfare children and adolescents . although a study among iranian adolescents showed that dietary behavior of adolescents does not accord to their knowledge , which emphasize on the necessity of community intervention programs . a recent study regarding the major dietary pattern among iranian children showed the presence of four major dietary patterns , in which fast food pattern and sweet pattern as two major dietary patterns can be mentioned among iranian children . in advocacy program audience 's analysis \\n accordingly , one of the prominent strategies in this study was working with media and was meeting with parent - teacher association that both of them were secondary target audiences \\n . we also took into account policy makers in different levels , from national to local as primary audiences . \\n advocacy team had several meetings with management and planning organization at national level and education organization of the fars province as well as principal of the targeted schools . \\n providing nutritious snacks need contribution of private sector such as food industries or factories , but their benefits should be warranted . \\n another choice was community involvement ; which can be achieved by female health volunteers who are working with the health system . \\n advocacy team by using the support of charities and female health volunteers could establish a local factory that produced student 's snacks based on the new definition . however , there are some challenges on the way of expanding this program . \\n mass production of the proposed snacks according to different desires and cultures and getting involvement of food industries with respect to marketing issues is one of those challenges . \\n moreover , providing a supportive environment in order to change the food habits of the students and their parents among the wide range of the population require a sustainable and continuous inter - sector collaboration . \\n although in a limited number of schools , in our study , interventions and advocacy program was successful , expanding this model to another areas around the country depends on convincing the policy makers at national level . in this \\n regard , advocacy team should prepare evidenced based profile and transitional planning to convince the policy makers for improving the rule and regulation of nffp . \\n the same as this study in other studies have also emphasized that there must be efforts to strengthen the capacity within the schools to deal with the nutritional problems either overweight , obesity or malnutrition by using of educational and nutritional intervention . \\n assessing the dietary adherence is very important in nutrition intervention among population . as this population was children and adolescents we had a limitation in the blood sample collection to assess the subject 's dietary adherence . \\n furthermore , this intervention was only focused on the intake of snack in school time and we did not have comprehensive information on the dietary intake of children and adolescents after school all over the day . \\n the investigators propose further investigation in different areas of the country based on socio - cultural differences in order to make necessary modification and adapt this model to other areas . \\n regarding the nutritional needs of the school age children , provision of a good platform for implementing and expanding this efficient model to the whole country based upon the socio - economic situation of each region is advisable to the moh and the moe . \\n community nutrition intervention based on the advocacy process model is effective on reducing the prevalence of underweight specifically among female school aged children .\",\n",
              "  'it occurs in more than 50% of patients and may reach 90% in certain types of cancers , especially in patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.1 anemia is defined as an inadequate circulating level of hemoglobin ( hb ) ( hb < 12 g / dl ) and may arise as a result of the underlying disease , bleeding , poor nutrition , chemotherapy , or radiation therapy . \\n preliminary studies suggest that survival and loco - regional control after radiation therapy , especially in head and neck cancers , may be compromised by anemia.24 anemia often worsens symptoms such as fatigue , weakness , and dyspnea , and thus may have a negative effect on quality of life ( qol ) and performance status in patients with cancer . \\n thus , to improve physical functioning , qol , and prognosis in patients with cancer , it would be reasonable to take a proactive approach in identifying populations who need treatment for cancer - associated anemia ( caa ) and provide timely management . \\n blood transfusion is an effective way to replace depleted hb within a short period , but the effect is , unfortunately , temporary and can cause serious adverse risks and increased mortality . in randomized clinical trials in patients with caa \\n , erythropoiesis - stimulating agents ( esas ) produced significant increases in hb level , decreased transfusion requirements , and improved qol.57 however , 30%50% of patients do not respond to such agents . \\n in addition , the use of esas often causes concern about severe adverse reactions.6,8 in several studies , esas were found to shorten overall survival time , or time to tumor progression in patients whose hb level reached more than 12 g / dl . \\n these studies included patients with different primary cancers , such as breast , lung , head and neck , cervix , and lymphomas.911 the lack of response to erythropoietin stimulation in patients with cancer is partly attributed to the functional iron deficiency state , in which the high rate of erythropoiesis exceeds the delivery of usable iron , despite adequate iron stores.12 absolute iron deficiency , in contrast , occurs when iron delivery is impaired because iron stores are depleted ( serum ferritin , < 100 ng / ml ; transferring saturation , < 20%).13 hepcidin , a peptide hormone produced by the liver , is up - regulated in chronic inflammatory states including cancer . \\n hepcidin inhibits iron transport across cell membranes , thus decreasing the accessibility of stored iron and gastrointestinal absorption of dietary iron , leading to an increased frequency of iron - restricted erythropoiesis.1416 many randomized trials examined the role of intravenous ( iv ) iron in addition to esas in the treatment of anemia in patients with cancer . \\n many of these studies showed improvement in esa response , time to maximal response , reduction in esa dose , and improvement in qol parameters ( when measured ) in favor of the combination over esas alone . \\n the observed benefit was independent of baseline iron parameters.1721 one study found a 36% reduction in the number of patients transfused.21 this pilot study assessed the efficacy and feasibility of iv iron monotherapy in patients with cancer who have anemia and who are undergoing treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy without the use of esas . \\n patients received the study treatment for 12 weeks followed by a 4-week follow - up period . \\n eligible patients were at least 18 years old , about to start a cycle of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy within 1 week of inclusion , and had a nonmyeloid malignancy , hb levels of 11.0 g / dl or less , a life expectancy of more than 24 weeks , and an eastern cooperative oncology group performance status of 02 . \\n patients were also required to have a serum ferritin level of 100 ng / ml or higher or transferrin saturation ( tsat ) levels of 15% or higher and to have received no esas or iv iron therapy within 30 days and no oral iron therapy ( 27 mg / day or more ) within 7 days before enrollment . \\n patients were excluded for leukoerythroblastic features on blood film , hemolysis , gastrointestinal bleeding , folate or vitamin b12 deficiency , elevated serum ferritin ( 900 ng / ml ) or transferrin saturation ( tsat ) ( 35% ) levels , pregnancy or lactation , liver dysfunction ( grade 2 or higher based on national cancer institute common toxicity criteria ) , renal dysfunction ( serum creatinine levels 2.0 mg / dl ) , active infection requiring systemic antibiotics , personal or family history of hemochromatosis , comorbidities precluding study participation , hypersensitivity to iv iron , red blood cell transfusion within the last 2 weeks , or any investigational agent within 30 days before enrollment . \\n patients were not allowed to take any vitamin , mineral , or herbal supplements containing 27 mg or more of iron per day or 100 mg vitamin c per day during the study or follow - up period . \\n blood transfusions were permitted at the primary physician s discretion if hb levels decreased to 8 g / dl or less , and such patients were considered treatment failures . \\n written informed consent was provided by all patients before study participation , and the protocol and supporting documents were approved by the institutional review board of king hussein cancer center . \\n the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and good clinical practice as contained in the us code of federal regulations that governs the protection of human subjects and the obligations of clinical investigators . \\n patients received 200 mg ferric hydroxide sucrose diluted in 100 ml normal saline and infused over the course of 1 hour weekly for a total of 12 weeks . the first dose was given during the first clinic visit ( 4 days from the initiation of chemotherapy or radiation therapy ) . \\n tsat was monitored , as protocol mandated withholding iron therapy when tsat levels were higher than 50% . at the first clinic visit ( week 1 ;

median , 1.6 g / dl ) . our study , \\n however , is peculiar in using iron therapy in a non - iron - deficiency state.28 iron overload after iv iron therapy , with potential concerns about the risk of developing secondary cancers and infection , might be raised . \\n the highest serum ferritin level in the present study in patients who completed at least 9 weeks of iv iron therapy was 1,170 ng / ml . most of the literature addressing cancer and infections in iron - overloaded patients comes from patients with hemochromatosis or patients who are undergoing hemodialysis . \\n published reviews report an increase in hepatocellular carcinoma only in patients with hemochromatosis after they develop cirrhosis.29 similarly data supporting the association between iv iron therapy and higher infection rate are weak and not well - supported.30 in fact , anemia itself is a risk factor for infections in patients receiving hemodialysis.31 a multivariate analysis of associations between iron and mortality in more than 58,000 patients receiving hemodialysis reported no increased death rate from serum ferritin levels as high as 1,200 ng / ml.30 the increasing cost of therapy in patients with cancer is of grave concern , which could be an additional benefit of iv iron over the use of esas in such patients . to further address many of the questions raised , \\n our team is planning a bigger trial for iv iron in patients with cancer who have anemia to confirm the results discussed in this pilot trial . \\n in addition , we will be looking into predictors of response to iv iron , such as serum hepcidin level . \\n iv iron therapy alone is safe and may be effective in improving hb levels in patients with cancer who are undergoing active anticancer therapy . \\n further randomized trials are needed to address many of the questions raised in our pilot study .',\n",
              "  \"tardive dystonia ( td ) , a rarer side effect after longer exposure to antipsychotics , is characterized by local or general , sustained , involuntary contraction of a muscle or muscle group , with twisting movements , generally slow , which may affect the limbs , trunk , neck , or face . \\n td has been shown to develop in about 3% of patients who have had long - term exposure to antipsychotics . \\n . the low risk of td for atypical antipsychotics is thought to result from their weak affinity for dopamine receptors . compared with typical , \\n atypical antipsychotic agents have a greater affinity for serotonin 5-ht2a than dopamine d2 receptors , with a low propensity to induce td . among this olanzapine \\n is thought to have preferential action at mesolimbic over nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways and is , therefore , associated with a very low incidence of extrapyramidal symptom ( eps ) . \\n furthermore , a retrospective analysis of controlled multicentric trials suggested that olanzapine also improves preexisting symptoms of tardive movements . \\n we report a case of 20-year - old male , belonging to lower socioeconomic class , educated up to 2 standard , presented with severe unilateral dystonic left sided neck movements [ figure 1 ] . \\n careful history exploration revealed he was taking risperidone 2 mg irregularly for 2 months and then olanzapine 5 mg for another 4 months . \\n picture of neck dystonia of patient at 19 years , the patient presented with occasional anger outbursts , getting provoked on small matters and beating family members , running away from home , screaming episodes occasionally , fearfulness , sleep disturbance for 2 days ;

              "  'lepidoptera include agricultural pests that , through feeding and other activities , negatively affect stored grains , food and fiber crops [ 2 , 3 ] . since a single lepidoptera adult can produce hundreds of eggs , and their primary food source is typically plant material , they can cause significant damage to agricultural crops . although biological agents can help manage these insect pests , insecticides currently are essential for large - scale effective and economical pest control . \\n these insecticides can also affect non - target organisms , including pollinators , and their application not only disrupts natural ecosystems but also reduces yields of crops that rely on pollination [ 5 , 6 ] . \\n the non - target effect of some pesticides is in part due to their effects on insect immunity , which is necessary for insect survival in natural environments . \\n for example , currently used pesticides have been shown to affect cellular [ 710 ] and humoral [ 11 , 12 ] immune responses and interfere with grooming behavior [ 13 , 14 ] . \\n these effects on immunity are likely non - specific and negatively impact the health of both the target pest and beneficial arthropods . \\n therefore , there is a need for novel target - specific approaches to control insect pests without affecting beneficial arthropods . \\n although immune pathways can be generally and non - specifically inhibited by pesticides , they also are a likely source of candidate molecules that could be inhibited for target - specific insect control since multiple classes of insect immunity genes , including signaling pathways , can be under strong selection for diversification . \\n fundamental mechanisms of innate immunity comprising cellular and humoral pathways are conserved throughout the animal kingdom   and are controlled by signaling pathways activated by various stimuli [ 17 , 18 ] , including pathogen recognition by immune surveillance systems . despite this overall conservation , \\n aspects of immune systems are subject to strong selection to evolve in response to varying pathogen exposure and to pathogen evolution of virulence determinants that modulate immunity [ 15 , 1921 ] \\n . such co - evolutionary dynamics can promote diversification of conserved elements of immunity as well as the recruitment of novel effectors . \\n as such , the investigation of insect immune pathways and mechanisms of pathogen modulation can yield insights into components that may be susceptible to inhibition . \\n for example , the insect pathogen xenorhabdus nematophila suppresses cellular and humoral immunity in the lepidopteran moths manduca sexta and spodoptera exigua [ 23 , 24 ] but not in the dipteran fly drosophila melanogaster , suggesting the stage of immunity suppressed by x. nematophila may be absent from d. melanogaster , but present in lepidoptera . \\n since dipteran flies serve as pollinators [ 26 , 27 ] , decomposers , food sources for other animals , and pest control agents , capitalizing on the possible differences between dipteran and lepidopteran immune signaling cascades will help in the identification of targets for pest - specific inhibition . with this knowledge in hand , \\n pest management can be achieved by developing small molecule inhibitors of these targets that will suppress pest insect immunity and lead to increased susceptibility to environmental pathogens . \\n indeed , many insecticides may contribute to insect ( target and non - target ) death by modulating aspects of immunity . \\n the feasibility of targeted pest control via insect immune inhibition has been established for termites ; a small molecule inhibitor of an immune surveillance protein led to faster termite death upon exposure to various pathogens . \\n much of our current knowledge of insect immune signaling pathways and receptor and effector function is based on the premiere model organism d. melanogaster , for which there are extensive genetic tools and several fully sequenced genomes . \\n well - established lepidopteran insect models such as the silkworm bombyx mori and the tobacco hornworm m. sexta also have been widely used to study insect immunity . \\n these organisms have been particularly useful for investigating hemolymph proteins and hemocyte function because of their relatively large larval size and hemolymph volume . \\n many insects in the order lepidoptera are easy to rear in laboratory conditions , and new tools such as rna interference have been implemented successfully to study genetics of their immune systems [ 30 , 31 ] . also , their immune signaling pathways are gradually being revealed by genomic and transcriptomic data [ 3238 ] . \\n based on these model insect systems a fairly detailed picture of immunity , from pathogen detection to effector function , is emerging , though many gaps remain , particularly with regard to components that are unique to different insect orders . here \\n we review aspects of insect immunity with an emphasis on the similarities and distinctions between d. melanogaster and representative lepidoptera . \\n in insects , the cellular immune response includes phagocytosis , nodulation and encapsulation [ 3942 ] and the humoral response involves the expression of antimicrobial peptides ( amps ) [ 43 , 44 ] as well as the pro - phenol oxidase ( propo ) proteolytic cascade that results in formation of melanized nodules and toxic reactive compounds [ 45 , 46 ] . \\n amps are small cationic peptides that insert into and disrupt microbial membranes , thereby killing and clearing pathogens . \\n they are synthesized by hemocytes and to a greater extent in fat body from which they are released into the insect hemolymph rapidly after microbial infection [ 43 , 47 ] . \\n amps are also expressed in extra - embryonic tissues of eggs , which may help protect the developing embryo from infection . \\n amps are a conserved component of immunity in plants   and animals   and while they have diverse structures most can be assigned to larger families such as cecropins , attacins , defensins and diptericins . \\n their diversity and immune effector function as well as their variant representation among insects ( table 1 ) have made them a central focus in the study of invertebrate pathology [ 30 , 52 ] . in d. melanogaster amp synthesis \\n each of these pathways is activated by detection of microbial components via different pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ) that trigger , through complex regulatory cascades , nuclear factor kappa b ( nf-b ) dependent transcription of the genes encoding amps . \\n after amps are translated in the cytoplasm they are released into the hemolymph where their high concentrations and broad activity are thought to enhance clearance of invading microorganisms from the insect . \\n bioinformatic and experimental data support the existence of the amp - inducing toll and imd pathways in lepidopterans , though not all components have been identified in model organisms such as m. sexta [ 32 , 35 ] . \\n the conserved presence of amps in immunity coupled with the possibility that certain elements of their induction pathways may vary among insects enhances the probability that microbially - induced amp expression could be inhibited in a pest - specific manner . as such , for the remainder of this review we focus on pathways leading to amp gene expression . \\n in d. melanogaster , transcription of amp - encoding genes is activated by the nf-b family transcription factors in response to infection [ 6569 ] with distinct nf-b family transcription factors responding to the toll and immune deficiency ( imd ) signal transduction pathways . in response to toll pathway activation , \\n the nf-b inhibitor cactus is phosphorylated and degraded allowing its targets , the nf-b factors dif and dorsal , to be translocated to the nucleus . \\n imd pathway activity culminates in the nf-b factor relish being activated by a stimulus - induced proteolytic cleavage . in the case of dif and dorsal \\n , gram - positive bacterial and fungal infections primarily serve as the stimuli that induce degradation of cactus through the toll signaling pathway . in general , gram - negative bacterial infections of d. melanogaster stimulate the proteolytic cleavage of relish through the imd pathway . once in the nucleus \\n , these transcription factors drive the transcription of immune effectors , including amp genes whose promoters contain nf-b binding sites [ 70 , 72 ] . \\n overall , nf-b proteins and their dna - binding specificities are conserved among organisms , including those lepidoptera studied to date [ 73 , 74 ] . \\n however , the nfb - binding regions for inhibitor of b ( ib ) proteins ( e.g. , cactus ) are not conserved , suggesting diversification and co - adaptation between ib and nfb pairs . \\n also , recent work indicates that nf-b nuclear co - regulators may contribute to species - specific regulation of amp gene expression . \\n therefore , modulation of inhibitors and nuclear - co - regulators of nf-b - dependent transcription may be one avenue by which target - specific immune suppression could be achieved . in d. melanogaster , \\n nf-b - dependent amp induction through the toll and imd pathways is activated by detection of microbial components via different pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ) . \\n prrs are soluble or membrane - bound proteins that bind to specific microbe associated molecular patterns ( mamps ) such as lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) , lipoteichoic acid ( lta ) , peptidoglycan ( pgn ) or -1,3-glucan that are released from or are found on the cell surfaces of bacteria or fungi . upon interaction with mamps , prrs can directly agglutinate pathogens or trigger proteolytic signaling cascades and cytokine release , which in turn lead to the activation of downstream cellular and humoral pathways , including pro - po activation and amp gene expression [ 16 , 65 , 76 ] . \\n pgn recognition proteins ( pgrps ) and -1,3-glucanase - related proteins ( grps ) were discovered in the lepidopteran silkworm ( b. mori ) by assaying for plasma components that activate the propo cascade . \\n pgrps were subsequently shown to be conserved across mammals and insects , and in d. melanogaster their role in the induction of amp gene expression through toll and imd pathways in response to pgn has been well documented [ 7983 ] . \\n similarly , grps have been shown to induce amp expression through toll pathway in response to fungal infections [ 79 , 84 ] . \\n in contrast , there is a dearth of literature linking specific pgrps or grps to amp induction in lepidoptera . \\n such a link is possible , since pgn and -1,3-glucan can activate amp gene expression in m. sexta and b. mori [ 8590 ] and multiple infection - induced pgrp- and grp - encoding genes have been identified in lepidoptera [ 32 , 38 , 54 , 55 , 9194 ] . \\n however , there are numerous hints that lepidoptera and diptera may have evolved divergent mechanisms of linking pathogen detection to conserved toll and imd signal transduction cascades . first , a genome comparison between b. mori and d. melanogaster failed to identify 1:1 pgrp orthologs . \\n similarly , b. mori gram - negative binding protein ( gnbp ) and m. sexta microbe binding protein ( mbp ) , members of the -1,3-glucanase - related protein superfamily [ 76 , 95 ] , appear to be distantly related to d. melanogaster gnbps , suggesting divergence of this group of proteins . \\n m. sexta mbp expression is strongly up - regulated in fat body after immune challenge and shows specific binding to lta , lps , dap - pgn . \\n also , in contrast to the situation in d. melanogaster , highly purified lps and lta are inducers of amp gene expression in lepidoptera , though not as potently as crude lps ( with contaminating pgn ) or purified pgn [ 85 , 90 , 96 , 97 ] . \\n this raises the possibility that different mamps or combinations of mamps are most efficacious in eliciting amp gene expression in lepidoptera relative to diptera . \\n also , since purified lps can elicit amp expression in lepidoptera but not d. melanogaster , lepidoptera have either a distinct repertoire of prrs responsible for lps - dependent triggering of imd or toll pathways , or an as - yet undiscovered pathway that links lps to amp induction . \\n testing these ideas awaits the identification of the suite of prrs and signal transduction pathways responsible for transducing lps , lta , pgn , or combinatorial microbial signals to amp gene expression . \\n one class of lepidopteran prr that may mediate infection - dependent induction of amps is the c - type lectins ( ctls ) , ca - dependent , secreted proteins that have carbohydrate - binding capabilities . \\n similar to some ctls of d. melanogaster , several ctls of m. sexta   and b. mori [ 54 , 99 ] are reported to mediate induction of cellular responses and the propo cascade . \\n although the nomenclature quickly becomes confusing , ctls include lipopolysaccharide - binding protein ( lbp ) . \\n m. sexta iml-1 binds to gram - positive and gram - negative bacteria as well as yeast , iml-2 shows specific binding to lps , iml-3 and iml-4 show specific binding to lps and lta , and iml-3 can also bind laminarin , a -1,3-glucan [ 103 , 104 ] . diversity in ctl \\n carbohydrate - binding specificities may result in lineage - specific pathogen recognition - signal transduction connections . \\n of particular relevance to the theme of this review are prrs present in lepidoptera but not diptera ( table 1 ) . in general , both orders of insects encode grps and pgrps . \\n however , specific representatives of each class are restricted to lepidoptera ( table 1 ) . \\n for example , the lepidopteran grp-2 , which binds fungal cell wall -1,3 glucans   and lta , is absent from diptera . \\n such derived grp and pgrps may contribute to lepidopteran - specific transduction of signals to downstream pathways . \\n other lepidoptera - specific prrs are hemolin and hemolymph proteinase-14 precursor ( prohp14 ) ( table 1 ) . like iml c - type lectins , \\n hemolin is an lps- and lta - binding prr   with roles in mediating cellular responses and as an opsonin to enhance phagocytosis . \\n hp14 has been shown to detect and bind a broad range of mamps , and may coordinate with grp1 or grp2 to activate propo [ 60 , 106 ] . \\n the potential role of the prrs discussed above in mediating the expression of amp genes remains to be determined , and further study of the lepidoptera - specific immune surveillance proteins and divergent activities of conserved prrs likely will yield novel avenues for pest - control . \\n d. melanogaster has both mamp - dependent and mamp - independent routes to activate the toll pathway . in mamp - dependent toll induction , bacterial lys - pgn ( typical of gram - positive bacteria ) \\n is detected by pgrp - sa or pgrp - sd ( in the presence of gnbp-1 ) , while yeast or fungal -1,3-glucan is detected by gnbp-3 [ 85 , 108 , 109 ] ( figure 1 ) . \\n mamp - independent stimuli are virulence determinants , such as proteases and chitinases , secreted by microbes and dubbed \\n mamps and mamp - independent stimuli each trigger a distinct proteolytic cascade   that both culminate in cleavage of the cytokine sptzle by the serine protease sptzle processing enzyme ( spe ) . \\n interaction of active sptzle c - terminal domain ( c-106 ) with the surface - localized toll receptor triggers an intracellular signal transduction terminating in induced expression of amps and cellular responses . \\n some of the basic components of the toll pathway are present in lepidoptera ( figure 2 ) . \\n m. sexta hemocytes express an infection - induced toll - like receptor and the genome of b. mori encodes 14 genes predicted to encode toll - like receptors as well as homologs of each of the intracellular components of toll - dependent signaling [ 85 , 114 , 115 ] . \\n both m. sexta and b. mori encode homologs of the d. melanogaster toll - activating cytokine sptzle   ( figure 2 ) . \\n also , for both m. sexta and b. mori there is experimental evidence linking the toll pathway with amp induction [ 116118 ] . in m. \\n sexta , toll pathway results in expression of several antimicrobial peptides , including attacin-1 , cecropin-6 , moricin and lysozyme . \\n in addition , the transcript level of hemolin , a pattern recognition protein exclusive to lepidopterans ( table 1 ) , is induced by injection of activated sptzle - c108 into larvae . despite the conservation of certain aspects of the toll pathway , the extracellular cascades that lead to sptzle activation may have diverged between d. melanogaster and the two lepidoptera ( figure 1 ) . \\n for example , in contrast to what is known in d. melanogaster , the m. sexta toll pathway is activated by gram - negative - associated mamps [ 115 , 118 ] . \\n also , the genome of b. mori lacks 1:1 orthologs of grass , spirit and persephone , the d. melanogaster serine proteases responsible for mamp / prr - dependent and mamp - independent cleavage of spe ( figure 1 ) . \\n progress has been made in identifying a m. sexta proteolytic cascade that results in processing pro - sptzle into its active c - terminal domain ( c-108 ) . \\n the direct cleavage is mediated by hemolymph proteinase ( hp ) 8 [ 11 , 13 ] , a homolog of d. melanogaster spe , in turn , hp8 is processed into its active form by hp6 . \\n hp6 is most similar to d. melanogaster persephone protease , which activates spe in response to mamp - independent stimuli [ 110 , 113 ] . \\n this hemolymph proteinase is activated in response to gram - positive or gram - negative bacteria and in response to -1,3-glucan . \\n however , the prrs and proteolytic cascade that transduce mamp signals to amp induction are unknown ( figure 1 ) . \\n the findings reviewed above demonstrate that while the overall architecture of the toll pathway is conserved among insects , the specific identities of proteolytic cascade members are distinct and many gaps remain in our understanding of toll activation in lepidoptera . filling these gaps should reveal potential lineage - specific molecules that can serve as targets to hinder the activation of the toll pathway in agricultural pests . in d. melanogaster \\n the imd pathway also contributes to amp gene induction and is triggered by direct interaction of dap - pgn , a mamp typical of gram - negative bacteria , with the transmembrane receptor pgrp - lc [ 82 , 83 , 125 , 126 ] . \\n for example , pgrp - le can act as an intracellular receptor for monomeric pgn   and its truncated form can enhance pgrp - lc - mediated recognition . \\n dap - pgn / pgrp - lc interaction activates intracellular imd , which then recruits fas - associated death domain ( fadd ) and death - related ced-3/nedd2-like protein ( dredd ) to form a complex [ 129 , 130 ] . \\n current evidence supports the idea that dredd , a caspase - like molecule , cleaves the nf-b transcription factor relish . \\n imd also appears to activate a phosphorelay : the transforming growth factor- ( tgf)-activated kinase 1 ( tak1 ) phosphorylates the ikb kinase ( ikk ) \\n relish cleavage into its activated amino - terminal transcriptional regulator domain allows its translocation into the nucleus , where it activates amp gene expression . \\n the translocation of relish into the nucleus is regulated by two recently discovered components of this pathway : inhibitor of apoptosis 2 ( iap2 ) and transforming growth factor - activated kinase 1 ( tak1)-binding protein 2 ( tab2 ) [ 132 , 133 ] . \\n both , iap2 and tab2 act upstream of relish and downstream of imd , while iap2 functions downstream of tak1 [ 132 , 134 ] . of particular importance to amp gene expression is iap2 , the knockdown of which hampers the sustained expression of amp genes . while iap2 and tab2 are necessary for imd signal transduction , the gene product of pirk , a recently characterized gene , interacts directly with imd and pgrp - lc . \\n pirk overexpression analyses revealed that it acts as a negative regulator by reducing the expression of the amp genes attacin b , cecropin b , and diptericin b , which are all under the control of the imd pathway . \\n most of the information available about the imd pathway in lepidoptera comes from bioinformatics ; orthologs of all intracellular components of the imd pathway have been found in b. mori [ 54 , 137 ] and m. sexta . \\n however , few experiments have been done to characterize the molecular mechanisms leading to activation of the imd pathway in these insects . in m. sexta \\n several genes of the imd pathway , including those encoding imd , fadd , tak1 , dredd and relish are up regulated in fat body of immune challenged 5th instar larvae   and in the midgut of b. mori during the wandering stage . \\n genes encoding lysozyme , moricin and defensin amps also were up regulated in the midgut of b. mori in the wandering stage , consistent with the possibility that amp induction is imd - mediated . finally , in the lepidopteran beet armyworm spodoptera exigua , rnai - mediated knockdown of relish expression resulted in loss of cecropin induction upon fungal infection , further strengthening the idea that the imd pathway may contribute to amp gene expression in lepidoptera , though perhaps it is triggered by distinct signals . \\n further study is needed to elucidate imd - mediated amp induction in lepidoptera and to reveal any differences there are in this pathway between diptera and lepidoptera . \\n in d. melanogaster , transcription of amp - encoding genes is activated by the nf-b family transcription factors in response to infection [ 6569 ] with distinct nf-b family transcription factors responding to the toll and immune deficiency ( imd ) signal transduction pathways . in response to toll pathway activation , \\n the nf-b inhibitor cactus is phosphorylated and degraded allowing its targets , the nf-b factors dif and dorsal , to be translocated to the nucleus . \\n imd pathway activity culminates in the nf-b factor relish being activated by a stimulus -

adaptation between ib and nfb pairs . \\n also , recent work indicates that nf-b nuclear co - regulators may contribute to species - specific regulation of amp gene expression . \\n therefore , modulation of inhibitors and nuclear -

specific approaches that will enable the effective control of insect pests . \\n however , before such approaches can be realized , the details of lepidopteran immune signaling pathways must be elucidated . \\n the relatively large sizes of last instar larvae of many lepidopteran species will facilitate biochemical approaches to such studies , while the establishment of immune - inducible lepidopteran cell lines such as the uga - cie1 cell line   can enable the characterization of molecular mechanisms leading to imd pathway activation and its contribution to amp gene expression . \\n finally , ongoing investigations into the immune - modulatory mechanisms of entomopathogens will help identify key steps in immunity that are susceptible to manipulation , contributing to the development of natural , cost - effective , non - toxic alternatives to chemical insecticides currently used for pest management .',\n",

like spells . \\n she had a 90% surgical resection of the tumor done in 2011 followed by radiation therapy in september 2012 . \\n her episodes occurred multiple times a day ( 7 per day on average ) during wakeful state . \\n they were triggered by coughing ( usually a bout of cough ) and were characterized by staring and unresponsiveness as well as stiffening of the body with mild shaking of both upper extremities . \\n she was diagnosed with epileptic seizures but continued to have episodes during treatment with the antiepileptic drugs ( aeds ) phenytoin , levetiracetam , and lamotrigine . \\n escalation of aed therapy made her increasingly drowsy , and she was on all three aforementioned aeds at the time of presentation . \\n her physical examination was remarkable for excessive drowsiness , mild dysarthria , right sixth cranial nerve palsy , mild hypertonia with hyperreflexia in the lower extremities ( left more than right ) , and bilateral ( left more than right ) ankle clonus . \\n she had a lumbar puncture done at the outside hospital , and the opening cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) pressure was reported to be 25  cm . \\n blood work was also unremarkable except for mild anemia ( hemoglobin : 9.4  g / dl ) , mild hyponatremia ( 132  meq / l ) , and mild hypokalemia ( 3.1  meq / l ) . \\n antiepileptic drug levels were within therapeutic range ( free phenytoin : 1.3  g / ml , levetiracetam : 5.9  g / ml , and lamotrigine : 2.3  g / ml ) . \\n all started with a bout of cough when the patient was lying in bed ( in supine or in lateral position ) which was followed by brief ( less than a minute ) distal upper extremity tremor and subtle proximal upper extremity myoclonic jerks and prolonged unresponsiveness for up to 10  min . \\n all of these episodes were associated with hypotension ( 7278/3147  mm of hg as revealed by continuous arterial pressure monitoring ) and bradycardia ( 5459  bpm ) . \\n the eeg during the spells was characterized by generalized synchronous and asynchronous high amplitude 1- to 2-hz delta activity which progressed to generalized attenuation and then transitioned to generalized delta activity again with recovery ( fig .  1 ) . \\n a head ct showed recurrence of the glomus jugulare tumor and communicating hydrocephalus . an external ventricular drain ( evd ) \\n after placement of the evd , her drowsiness gradually started to improve , and episodes decreased in frequency to one per day . \\n 3 showed an enhancing t2 hyperintense left skull base mass in the region of the left jugular foramen with extension into the posterior cranial fossa and below the base of the skull . \\n brain imaging showed evidence of hydrocephalus that had increased compared with her previous brain imaging done 2  months back . \\n her mental status continued to improve , and she had only one mild episode triggered by cough during the next two days before her discharge . \\n repeat surgical resection of the tumor was recommended by the otolaryngology team , which the patient declined . \\n based on the clinical features and eeg findings , the episodes observed in our patient are most consistent with cough syncope . \\n the mechanism underlying cough syncope is not definitively established , but it is postulated that coughing increases intrathoracic and intraabdominal pressures leading to a transient increase in icp . increased icp , in turn , causes a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure which , if it drops below a critical level , may result in global cerebral hypoperfusion leading to syncope . \\n transient cerebral circulatory arrest has been demonstrated by transcranial doppler measurements during cough syncope . our patient also had a drop in blood pressure and heart rate but probably not sufficient to cause syncope by itself . \\n cough syncope has been associated with posterior fossa mass lesions or tonsillar herniation and with hydrocephalus . \\n it may be speculated that bouts of cough caused transient herniation of cerebellar tonsils obstructing csf flow that further contributed to the increase in icp during coughing . \\n decrease in frequency of events following placement of evd to relieve icp lends support to this notion . \\n paragangliomas are rare tumors of extraadrenal chromaffin cell origin that most commonly occur in the head and neck region . \\n catecholamine - hypersecreting paraganglionomas are uncommon in the head and neck region , and most patients ( 95% ) with hypersecreting paraganglionomas have hypertension . \\n hypotension accompanying syncope observed in our patient was not orthostasis - related ( the patient was always supine during spells ) and was most likely related to cough . \\n identified a subset of patients with cough syncope who lacked a blood pressure overshoot ( expected response ) after the relief of straining during valsalva maneuver . \\n the authors postulate that cough syncope in these patients might be the result of delayed recovery from hypotension that follows a paroxysm of cough , and this was likely contributing to global cerebral hypoperfusion in our patient . \\n this case highlights the fact that cough syncope , a rare form of syncope , may be associated with intracranial mass lesions that indirectly exaggerate the increase in icp in response to cough . \\n glomus caroticum tumor presenting as recurrent unexplained syncope   and posterior fossa meningioma presenting as recurrent cough syncope   have been described . \\n recurrent cough syncope should trigger search for factors , including brain tumors , with the potential to cause transient elevation in icp . \\n this case also illustrates an important role for ceeg monitoring with video in distinguishing syncope from seizures in cough syncope cases . \\n '],\n",

            " although anxiety and depression are often related and coexist in pd patients , recent research suggests that anxiety rather than depression is the most prominent and prevalent mood disorder in pd [ 5 , 6 ] . yet , \n",
            " our current understanding of anxiety and its impact on cognition in pd , as well as its neural basis and best treatment practices , remains meager and lags far behind that of depression . \n",
            " overall , neuropsychiatric symptoms in pd have been shown to be negatively associated with cognitive performance . \n",
            " for example , higher depression scores have been correlated with lower scores on the mini - mental state exam ( mmse ) [ 8 , 9 ] as well as tests of memory and executive functions ( e.g. , attention ) [ 1014 ] . \n",
            " likewise , apathy and anhedonia in pd patients have been associated with executive dysfunction [ 10 , 1523 ] . \n",
            " however , few studies have specifically investigated the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd . \n",
            " one study showed a strong negative relationship between anxiety ( both state and trait ) and overall cognitive performance ( measured by the total of the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status index ) within a sample of 27 pd patients . \n",
            " furthermore , trait anxiety was negatively associated with each of the cognitive domains assessed by the rbans ( i.e. , immediate memory , visuospatial construction , language , attention , and delayed memory ) . \n",
            " two further studies have examined whether anxiety differentially affects cognition in patients with left - sided dominant pd ( lpd ) versus right - sided dominant pd ( rpd ) ; however , their findings were inconsistent . \n",
            " the first study found that working memory performance was worse in lpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd patients with anxiety , whereas the second study reported that , in lpd , apathy but not anxiety was associated with performance on nonverbally mediated executive functions and visuospatial tasks ( e.g. , tmt - b , wms - iii spatial span ) , while in rpd , anxiety but not apathy significantly correlated with performance on verbally mediated tasks ( e.g. , clock reading test and boston naming test ) . \n",
            " furthermore , anxiety was significantly correlated with neuropsychological measures of attention and executive and visuospatial functions . taken together , \n",
            " it is evident that there are limited and inconsistent findings describing the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd and more specifically how anxiety might influence particular domains of cognition such as attention and memory and executive functioning . \n",

            " future studies should also examine whether treating neuropsychiatric symptoms might impact the progression of cognitive decline and improve cognitive impairments in pd patients . \n",
            " previous studies have used pd symptom laterality as a window to infer asymmetrical dysfunction of neural circuits . \n",
            " for example , lpd patients have greater inferred right hemisphere pathology , whereas rpd patients have greater inferred left hemisphere pathology . \n",
            " thus , cognitive domains predominantly subserved by the left hemisphere ( e.g. , verbally mediated tasks of executive function and verbal memory ) might be hypothesized to be more affected in rpd than lpd ; however , this remains controversial . \n",
            " it has also been suggested that since anxiety is a common feature of left hemisphere involvement [ 48 , 49 ] , cognitive domains subserved by the left hemisphere may also be more strongly related to anxiety . \n",
            " results from this study showed selective verbal memory deficits in rpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd without anxiety , whereas lpd patients with anxiety had greater attentional / working memory deficits compared to lpd without anxiety . \n",
            " although these results align with previous research , interpretations of these findings should be made with caution due to the small sample size in the lpd comparison specifically . \n",
            " recent work has suggested that the hads questionnaire may underestimate the burden of anxiety related symptomology and therefore be a less sensitive measure of anxiety in pd [ 30 , 50 ] . in addition , our small sample size also limited the statistical power for detecting significant findings . \n",
            " based on these limitations , our findings are likely conservative and underrepresent the true impact anxiety has on cognition in pd . additionally , the current study employed a very brief neuropsychological assessment including one or two tests for each cognitive domain . \n",
            " future studies are encouraged to collect a more complex and comprehensive battery from a larger sample of pd participants in order to better understand the role anxiety plays on cognition in pd . \n",
            " another limitation of this study was the absence of diagnostic interviews to characterize participants ' psychiatric symptoms and specify the type of anxiety disorders included in this study . \n",
            " future studies should perform diagnostic interviews with participants ( e.g. , using dsm - v criteria ) rather than relying on self - reported measures to group participants , in order to better understand whether the type of anxiety disorder ( e.g. , social anxiety , phobias , panic disorders , and generalized anxiety ) influences cognitive performance differently in pd . \n",
            " one advantage the hads questionnaire provided over other anxiety scales was that it assessed both anxiety and depression simultaneously and allowed us to control for coexisting depression . \n",
            " although there was a trend that the pda+ group self - reported higher levels of depression than the pda group , all participants included in the study scored < 6 on the depression subscale of the hads . \n",
            " controlling for depression while assessing anxiety has been identified as a key shortcoming in the majority of recent work . \n",
            " considering many previous studies have investigated the influence of depression on cognition in pd without accounting for the presence of anxiety and the inconsistent findings reported to date , we recommend that future research should try to disentangle the influence of anxiety versus depression on cognitive impairments in pd . considering the growing number of clinical trials for treating depression , there are few if any for the treatment of anxiety in pd . \n",
            " anxiety is a key contributor to decreased quality of life in pd and greatly requires better treatment options . \n",
            " moreover , anxiety has been suggested to play a key role in freezing of gait ( fog ) , which is also related to attentional set - shifting [ 52 , 53 ] . \n",
            " future research should examine the link between anxiety , set - shifting , and fog , in order to determine whether treating anxiety might be a potential therapy for improving fog .\n",
            "\n",
            "Abstract:\n",
            "research on the implications of anxiety in parkinson 's disease ( pd ) has been neglected despite its prevalence in nearly 50% of patients and its negative impact on quality of life . \n",
            " previous reports have noted that neuropsychiatric symptoms impair cognitive performance in pd patients ; however , to date , no study has directly compared pd patients with and without anxiety to examine the impact of anxiety on cognitive impairments in pd . \n",
            " this study compared cognitive performance across 50 pd participants with and without anxiety ( 17 pda+ ; 33 pda ) , who underwent neurological and neuropsychological assessment . \n",
            " group performance was compared across the following cognitive domains : simple attention / visuomotor processing speed , executive function ( e.g. , set - shifting ) , working memory , language , and memory / new verbal learning . \n",
            " results showed that pda+ performed significantly worse on the digit span forward and backward test and part b of the trail making task ( tmt - b ) compared to the pda group . \n",
            " there were no group differences in verbal fluency , logical memory , or tmt - a performance . in conclusion , \n",

tags were applied . during the study , \\n extraordinarily long - distance movements for 3 subadult females were plotted by satellite telemetry readings ( figure 1 ) . in january 2014 , a 2.5-year - old female buffalo collared in south africa walked a maximum direct distance of 95 km . in 6 days , she crossed into zimbabwe , then into mozambique , and into zimbabwe again to enter gonarezhou np , with localizations within the home range of the buffalo herd in which btb was first diagnosed in a female buffalo in 2008 ( 6 ) . \\n this subadult buffalo later left the park and visited a commercial farm area before reentering gonarezhou np . in february 2014 \\n , another 4-year - old female buffalo walked a direct distance of 64 km in 8 days . \\n finally , in march 2013 , a 4.5-year - old female captured in july 2011 was sighted in a location deep into communal land at a distance of 96 km from her capture site . \\n in contrast to these young female buffalo , no adult females collared in this study moved such long distances outside their home range during 20082014 . \\n the long - distance travel of these 3 subadult females occurred over a few days during the rainy season ( figure 2 ) and included movements outside the gltfca boundary . \\n cumulative home - range area of 15 buffalo collared with global positioning system devices in kruger national park , south africa , in november 2013 . only buffalo with collars that functioned for an entire year are displayed . \\n data for 2 subadult female buffalo ( paths displayed in figure 1 ) are shown ( id65 and id68 ) separately from data for the 13 other buffalo ( subadult and adult females ) . \\n our findings strengthen the hypothesis that btb was spread from kruger np to gonarezhou np through buffalo - to - buffalo transmission by subadult females that dispersed from their native herds . \\n buffalo populations in kruger and gonarezhou nps are connected through long - distance movements of individuals , specifically prebreeding heifers . \\n although this movement is important for buffalo conservation in tfcas , it could also facilitate the spread of animal diseases , including zoonoses , across borders . in 2010 and 2011 , \\n btb , rift valley fever , and brucellosis were detected in kruger np buffaloes , although a previous study failed to detect brucellosis in the gonarezhou np population ( 9 ) ( table ) . \\n buffalo id65 , which was initially captured in kruger np , was seen among a breeding herd in gonarezhou np , indicating the possibility of direct , buffalo - to - buffalo transmission of btb by dispersing infected individuals , without the need for bridge hosts ( e.g. , other wild or domestic ungulate species ) ( 10 ) . \\n * individuals and herds belong to the same population ( see figure 1 , adult female home range ) . \\n calf , < 2.5 y of age ; subadult , 2.54.5 y ; adult , > 4.5 y.  laboratory tests used : for bovine tuberculosis , gamma - interferon test and isolation ; for brucellosis , rose bengal and complement fixation tests ; for rift valley fever , indirect elisa test . \\n published results ( 9 ) for the same diseases tested in the gonarezhou national park buffalo population in zimbabwe are shown in parentheses . \\n difference between kruger and gonarezhou population results for brucellosis was significant by fisher exact test for equality of proportion for small samples ( p<0.02 ) . \\n additional ecological information on buffalo dispersion is needed : frequency of dispersion events ; size , age , and sex composition of the dispersing groups ; and information about whether dispersed individuals later return to their home ranges . \\n subadult females appear to be particularly prone to dispersing behavior , unlike adult females , and we speculate that they may do so in small groups of individuals that are approximately the same age ( 8) . \\n no record exists of subadult female buffalo mixing with male bachelor groups , which are also known to connect to adjacent herds ( 7 ) . \\n . one possible explanation may be an out - breeding mechanism ( 11 ) that occurs before the start of reproduction ; subadult females may leave their native herd to begin their reproduction in a distant herd to minimize in - breeding . furthermore , abundant resources ( i.e. , water and grazing areas ) available during the rainy season maximize the probability of success of such behavior . \\n we found that subadult females were infected with btb , brucellosis , and rift valley fever ( table ) , diseases with different mechanisms of transmission . \\n age and social position in the herd may influence individuals rate of exposure to pathogenic infections and consequently may affect the dynamics of infection within and between herds . \\n our results indicate that subadult female buffalo could play a role in the spread of diseases among distant populations , across protected areas and international borders , and during the rainy season . \\n this seasonal pattern contrasts with the timing of most wildlife and livestock contact between adult females , which has been observed to occur predominantly during the dry season in the study area ( 4 ) . \\n buffalo have been observed far outside the boundaries of protected areas , even outside the gltfca , in communal land where livestock farming is the main livelihood ; these observations considerably widen the wildlife  livestock interface area where disease spread can occur ( 12 ) . \\n livestock interfaces can encompass large areas , rather than being a fence or strip of land at the edge of protected areas . \\n these data should assist in refining disease modeling by showing the importance of temporal and spatial considerations and by redefining variables ( e.g. , age and sex ) involved in risk for pathogen spillover or emergence ( i.e. , identifying super - spreaders ) ( 13 ) . \\n our results suggest that the spillover of btb and other zoonoses at the wildlife  livestock  human interface constitutes a risk to animal and human health in the gltfca ( 9,14 ) . \\n the health issue in tfcas can not be overlooked and must be part of any management decision . combining ecological and epidemiologic knowledge is necessary to understand disease dynamics in these complex agro - ecosystems .\",\n          \"isolated dislocation of the radial head in adults is a rare injury with less than 30 cases reported in literature [ 1 - 9 ] . \\n if neglected , these can cause restriction of forearm supination and pronation , secondary degenerative arthritis of the elbow and distal radio - ulnar joints later on . \\n this important injury can easily be missed in the presence of other major associated injuries . also since with this injury there is no limitation of elbow flexion - extension and limitation of prono \\n supination is relatively less disabling , the patient may tend to ignore the disability and present late . \\n lastly the mushrooming of unlawful and uncontrolled bone setters can make the simple injuries complicated and problematic later on . \\n a 26-year old man presented to us 8 weeks after injury to his right elbow with a motorbike accident . \\n the patient complained of pain in the right elbow immediately after accident though he was able to flex and extend the elbow . \\n thinking it to be a trivial injury he went to a bone setter for treatment , who applied wooden splints after oil massage to the elbow . \\n however , the patient had pain in the elbow and presented to us after further 4 weeks with gross limitation of supination and pronation . \\n there was no previous history of elbow injury or arthritis . on examination , there was minimal swelling over the elbow and tenderness over the radial head , which appeared displaced backwards . \\n although he had good flexion and extension of the elbow , forearm pronation and supination were grossly restricted and painful . \\n radiographs showed posterior dislocation of the radial head with no associated fractures of the radius , ulna or disruption of the distal radio - ulnar joint . \\n immobilisation was done in flexion and supination and continued for three weeks with serial radiographs done at week 1 and 2 to make sure the superior radio - ulnar joint was in reduced position ( fig . \\n 2 ) . elbow mobilisation was started after removal of the plaster , under supervision of the physiotherapist . \\n the patient was followed up at 3 and 6 months . at 6 months he had no residual pain at the elbow and movements of elbow \\n 26 year old man presenting with 8 weeks old isolated posterior dislocation of right radial head with limitation of prono - supination at right elbow . \\n post operative radiographs showing excision of the radial head three months follow up showing good range of prono supination \\n isolated dislocation of the radial head with no other associated fracture or dislocation of elbow is rare but not unknown injury in adults is a rare injury [ 1 - 5 ] . \\n reduction in such cases is easily achieved by a pronation / supination manoeuvre   and most authors propose immobilization of the elbow in flexion and supination in a plaster cast . \\n the proximal radio - ulnar joint is most stable in supination : in this position , the contact between radius and ulna is maximal and the interosseous membrane , the annular ligament , and the anterior fibres of the quadrate ligament are all taut , thus drawing the radial head snugly against its notch in the ulna , cadaveric studies have shown that posterior dislocation of the radial head can not occur without the rupture of the annular ligament ; in addition , partial tear of the quadrate ligament and the proximal interosseous membrane takes place . \\n most acute cases can be reduced closed and the functional outcome seems to be good post reduction . \\n if missed or neglected , an open reduction has to be done with either an annular ligament reconstruction   or a radial head excision deemed as the procedure of choice . in this case radial head excision \\n the period of immobilisation was 21 days . in the presence of major distracting injuries like long bone fractures , pelvic fractures , chest and abdominal injuries , \\n an isolated radial head dislocation can be easily missed as pain is masked by the presence of major distracting injuries and flexion and extension of the elbow is almost normal . even if it is an isolated injury patient \\n may take it as a minor injury because of normal flexion and extension at elbow . \\n therefore occurrence of such an injury must be kept in mind in all cases of elbow trauma and supination and pronation of the forearm must be assessed . \\n this injury if missed can have serious repercussions later on , such as degenerative arthritis of the elbow and the distal radio - ulnar joints . \\n there is also need for awareness amongst the public about the dangers of going to bonesetters , even for small injuries after any accident .\",\n          \"acute pancreatitis ( ap ) is an acute inflammatory process of the pancreas with variable severity \\n . it can be severe and associated with systemic or local complications , especially those with infected pancreatic or peripancreatic necrosis ( ipn ) . \\n gastrointestinal ( gi ) fistula is one of the well - recognized complications secondary to severe ap . \\n depending on the sites of fistula , it may involve the stomach , duodenum , jejunum , ileum , and colon , either in combination or separately . \\n it may result from direct erosion from digestive enzymes released by the inflamed pancreas on adjacent gi tract , or it could occur as a consequence of the intestinal necrosis due to vascular thrombosis in an area of inflammation and infection . \\n although previous studies suggest the fistula of gi tract occurs infrequently in ap patients , ipn and the operative managements for ipn would increase the frequency . \\n it has been reported gi fistulas may cause serious clinical consequences such as hemorrhage and exacerbation of infection with fatal outcome . in this retrospective study we aimed to evaluate the incidence and clinical outcome of gi fistulas in the setting of ap with ipn \\n clinical data from patients with gi fistula secondary to ap between january 1 , 2010 and december 31 , 2013 in our center were retrospectively reviewed . \\n ap was diagnosed according to clinical presentation ( typically abdominal pain ) , laboratory parameters ( serum amylase or lipase levels exceeding 3 times the upper limit of normal ) and abdominal imaging by contrast - enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) . \\n contrast - enhanced ct was performed for all patients within 72  hours since admission . \\n ipn was diagnosed according to the positive gram stain and culture results of pancreatic or peripancreatitic necrotic tissue obtained by means of ct guided fine needle aspiration , or from the first percutaneous drainage or operation . \\n the severity was defined according to the determinant - based classification of acute pancreatitis severity . \\n fistula was defined as pathological communications that connect any portion of gi tract with the necrotic cavity , the peritoneal space , the retroperitoneal areas , or another internal organ . \\n diagnosis of gi fistula was based on fistulography , digestive endoscopy , or operative findings . \\n data pertaining to the severity of ap , the severity score , ct severity score , interval between onset of ap and admission to our center , interval between onset of ap and detection of gi fistula , location of gi fistula , intervention for gi fistula and ipn , and outcomes were recorded . \\n continuous data were compared using a student t test , and categorical data were analyzed using a chi -

recognized complication of ap , it has been reported in limited literature recently . in this study , we reported our experience with gi fistula in ap with ipn in our center . \\n the incidence of gi fistula varied from 3% to 47% in different studies depending on different study population , but all these studies included small number of cases . in the present retrospective study , we found 119 ( 38.3% ) patients with gi fistula among 311 ap patients with ipn , and the overall incidence in all ap patients in our center was 12.8% . \\n furthermore , enzyme - rich fluid and necrosis can lead to vascular thrombosis , which compromise the blood supply of the segmental gi tract , leading to bowel necrosis eventually . in our study , all the patients with gi fistula had necrotizing pancreatitis with ipn . with regard to the time of occurrence of gi fistula during the course of ap , 84.9% patients had gi fistula beyond 1 month , which suggests that development of gi fistulas is associated with the long - term effects of the pancreatic or peripancreatic inflammation and infection . \\n it was reported that frequent debridement and controlled open drainage may increase the incidence of intestinal fistulas in 1989 . and \\n a study published in 1995 from mayo clinic showed that 19 out of 61 ( 31.2% ) patients developed gi fistulas after surgical management while only 4 ( 6.6% ) were found at the time of initial operation . during recent years \\n , the mainstream management of ap with ipn has changed from open necrosectomy to minimally invasive techniques based step - up approach . \\n our patients were treated by step - up approach but with a similar incidence of gi fistula and 54.6% patients were detected with gi fistula before performing first open necrosectomy . \\n it was also observed previously that the approach for ipn management did not affect incidence of gi fistula . \\n it suggests that at present time step - up approach might not reduce the risk of iatrogenic gi injury . \\n in addition , it had been recommended that severe ap should be treated in multidisciplinary specialist units , which included icu specialists , interventional endoscopists , diagnostic and interventional radiologists , and surgeons . \\n our results showed that 133 of ipn patients had operative procedures before transfer and 45.9% developed fistula as opposed to 15.7% of those transferred in who did not have operation . \\n gi fistula could involve the stomach , duodenum , jejunum , ileum , and colon , either in combination or separately . \\n same to other studies , colonic fistula was the commonest form of gi fistulas in our study , which was found in 72 patients and duodenal fistula the second ( 53 patients ) . \\n the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon may include : first , the anatomy characteristics of peritoneal reflection results in colon and duodenal more frequently affected directly . \\n second , gut ischemia , as a result of low - flow state or hemodynamic response to sepsis , may be more commonly associated with colon . \\n furthermore , the stomach and small intestine have a much better blood supply , which could provide a protective mechanism for preventing the formation of fistula . \\n it has been reported that most upper - gut fistulas could close with time and colonic fistulas may require active intervention . \\n in our center , fistulas of upper gi tract , jejunum , and ileum usually closed spontaneously with time if infected source could be well controlled while approximately 7 out of 10 colonic fistulas needed to be managed by enterostomy . \\n however , a study which reviewed 43 reports suggested that colonic fistulas which became apparent after percutaneous pancreatic drainage might close spontaneously . \\n moreover , several reports showed colonic fistula could close with the aid of nonsurgical techniques such as percutaneous drainage and endoscopic therapy . in our study , 21 colonic fistula closed spontaneously with conservative management . \\n our experience is that those excrement can be completely drained by nonsurgical techniques would close spontaneously . \\n gi fistula may cause clinical consequences such as gi hemorrhage and sepsis which might lead to death eventually . in our study , patients with gi fistula were associated with more severe disease course and suffered more organs failure . \\n on the other hand , gi fistula could potentially benefit the patient by draining ipn into gi tract . in persistence to previous studies that suggested gi fistula did not increase mortality , \\n the death rate of patients with gi fistula in our study did not differ significantly from those without gi fistula . \\n however , subgroup analyses showed mortality of patients with colonic fistula was significantly higher than that in patients without gi fistula , namely , colonic fistula was related with higher mortality . \\n the actual incidence of gi fistula could be lower than ours because the patients admitted to our center were so complicated that most of them had been treated in other facilities for a long time , even with percutaneous drainage or open necrosectomy , and some patients had been diagnosed with gi fistula before transferred . \\n the heterogeneity of our patients and variable lengths of time to referral to our center would impact the reliability of conclusions regarding identification of factors associated with fistula formation and predictors of death . and \\n some data in previous facilities were incomplete . additionally , it was a single - center retrospective study . in conclusion , \\n colonic and duodenal fistulas are the two commonest forms of gi fistula in ipn patients , and most of them could close spontaneously with proper nonsurgical management except approximately 70% of colonic fistulas needing surgical intervention . for the clinical outcome , the occurrence of colonic fistula is associated with worse outcome .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10700,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"we report on the long -

ctla-4 blockade ( e.g. , ipilimumab ) and anti - pd-1 antibodies ( e.g. , nivolumab ) has improved the poor prognosis of unresectable malignant melanoma [ 1 , 2 ] . \\n these newly approved medications induce many types of immune - related adverse events ( iraes ) , including pneumonitis , colitis , hepatitis , and endocrinopathies such as hypophysitis and thyroiditis . \\n although iraes induced by ipilimumab have occasionally been reviewed in the literature , studies on nivolumab are also gradually being described . \\n a 52-year - old male with lung and liver metastasis of malignant melanoma was put on nivolumab therapy ( 3 mg / kg every 3 weeks ) . after approximately 34 weeks of nivolumab administration ( fig . \\n 1 ) , laboratory tests revealed a sudden elevation of liver enzymes ( ast / alt ) to 1,225/824 u / l ( grade 4 ) . \\n computed tomography detected the exacerbation of liver metastasis , identifying a lesion that was slightly larger than the nondiffuse , localized lesion that had been observed 3 months earlier ( fig . \\n 2 ) . therefore , we suspected hepatitis associated with nivolumab because this drug has a low probability of causing serious liver damage to localized lesions , even when they are large . \\n the patient stopped taking nivolumab and was treated with 70 mg / day ( 1.0 mg / kg / day ) of systemic corticosteroids . \\n his ast / alt level promptly improved to 112/389 u / l within 3 days . \\n the median onset of ipilimumab - related hepatitis is approximately 812 weeks after initial treatment . \\n therefore , the interval from nivolumab initiation to the occurrence of hepatitis was much longer than that reported in previous cases . \\n hepatitis induced by nivolumab was also observed at 712 weeks in a pooled analysis of a nivolumab phase iii trial . \\n however , the incidence of grade 23 nivolumab - induced hepatitis was approximately 1% in a phase iii clinical study . in that study , \\n the liver function test improved to grade 1 within 415 days of initiation of corticosteroid treatment . \\n the liver dysfunction caused by long - term nivolumab therapy in this case is noteworthy . \\n although many diseases induce liver dysfunction , in this case , we definitively excluded other causes of hepatitis such as viral infection ( e.g. , hbv , hcv , hsv , cmv , and ebv ) , medication other than nivolumab , and other forms of autoimmune hepatitis . to manage hepatitis associated with nivolumab , these possibilities must be excluded as causes of the disease . \\n the recommended initial treatment of hepatitis in the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy ( rems ) is to administer systemic corticosteroids ( 12 mg / kg / day of prednisone ) . \\n if the symptoms continue after 35 days , alternative immunosuppressive therapy , such as 500 mg of oral mycophenolate mofetil every 12 h , must be considered . in this case , because the laboratory test showed an ast / alt level > 20 the upper limit of normal , we considered systemic corticosteroids to be the most appropriate treatment . \\n fortunately , the ast / alt level rapidly improved to grade 12 in 3 days , and modification was not necessary . \\n it is very important to note that severe hepatitis can occur despite long - term nivolumab therapy . in this case , \\n it was possible to quickly reach a correct diagnosis because we were aware of the possibility of drug - induced hepatitis , even though the period of occurrence of nivolumab - induced hepatitis had passed . \\n therefore , we believe that this report may be very informative when treating hepatitis as an irae of nivolumab . in addition , to our knowledge , this patient exhibited the longest time between nivolumab administration and the onset of hepatitis that has been reported to date . \\n  \\n \",\n          \"pulmonary tuberculosis is divided into primary and post - primary types according to pathogenic and radiological features . \\n pleural involvement is generally seen in the form of a pleural effusion , which can be a component of both primary and post - primary tuberculosis . \\n empyema , residual pleural thickening and calcification are other forms of pleural tuberculosis involvement and are generally seen in association with parenchymal disease . in approximately two - thirds of cases \\n , there is no associated parenchymal lesion on the chest radiograph ; yet tubercle bacilli are frequently found in biopsy specimens of pleural tissue . \\n we report an unusual form of pleural tuberculosis demonstrated by pleuroscopy and computed tomography ( ct ) presenting with multiple pleural nodules and masses with large hemorrhagic pleural effusion and without any evidence of either parenchymal or lymphatic disease . \\n a 68-year - old male was admitted with complaints of gradually progressive exertional dyspnea and dry cough of three months duration . \\n he had pleuritic chest pain , low grade fever and weight loss for one month . \\n his routine hemogram , urine examination , renal and liver function tests and coagulation profile were normal except raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate . \\n chest x - ray was suggestive of large right - sided pleural effusion . at thoracentesis , \\n it was a lymphocytic exudate ( total protein  3.4 g / dl , sugar  76 mg / dl , cholesterol  67 mg / dl , lactate dehydrogenase  253 iu / l , adenosine deaminase  9 \\n polymorphs : 5% , lymphocytes : 92% , cytology  negative for malignant cells , gram stain and afb smear  negative ) . \\n post - aspiration chest x - ray showed multiple irregular pleural masses [ figure 1 ] . \\n ct of the chest revealed multiple different size masses involving the parietal as well as visceral pleura [ figure 2 ] . \\n post taping chest x - ray shows multiple irregular pleural masses computed tomography ( ct ) chest shows multiple different size masses on parietal pleura as well as on visceral pleura a medical pleuroscopy was performed using a flexible bronchoscope placed through the chest tube . \\n multiple pleural - based ( parietal as well as visceral ) masses of varying sizes were observed . \\n histopathological examination of the pleural biopsy from a parietal pleural mass revealed epitheloid cell granulomas indicative of tuberculosis [ figure 3 ] . \\n the major differential diagnostic considerations in a patient with multiple pleural nodules and masses are malignant mesothelioma , pleural lymphoma , hematogenous pleural metastases , malignant thymoma and on rare occasion sarcoidosis.[38 ] although pleural tb infection is thought to result from the rupture of a subpleural caseous focus within the lung into the pleural space , it may occasionally be as a result of hematogenous dissemination or contamination from adjacent infected lymph nodes . \\n pleural infection in tuberculosis is usually characterized by an effusion in early stages , or by diffuse pleural thickening and adhesions often with calcification in long standing cases . \\n pleural thickening may also result from chronic inflammatory conditions , for example , hemothorax , empyema , tubercular effusion , or recurrent pneumothorax , often with calcification . in our case \\n the provisional diagnosis was a pleural neoplasm ( primary or secondary ) based on clinical , radiological and pleuroscopic findings . \\n to our knowledge , pleural tuberculosis presenting with multiple pleural nodules and masses without parenchymal involvement or lymphadenopathy have been reported rarely in the standard english medical literature,[1113 ] but pleural tuberculosis presenting as multiple pleural masses with large hemorrhagic pleural effusion has not been reported . \\n it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pleural masses without radiographically visible parenchymal lung disease even when there is large hemorrhagic effusion . \\n confirmation of the diagnosis with sputum smears , culture , or histology is mandatory since treatment is highly successful .\",\n          \"the unicornuate uterine anomaly is often difficult to diagnose and usually low on the list of differential diagnoses for pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea . the authors present a case of a rudimentary uterine horn as a cause for continued pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea in a previously hysterectomized woman \\n a 43-year - old woman , gravida 1 , para 1 , presented for evaluation of right lower quadrant pain of several years duration . \\n laparoscopy revealed a solid mass in the right pelvis that was diagnosed as a rudimentary uterine horn . \\n uterine anomalies , although uncommon , should be thought of as part of the differential diagnosis for pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea . \\n a thorough inspection of the pelvis should be performed at the time of any operative procedure for abdominal pain . \\n the american society for reproductive medicine has sub - classified the unicornuate uterine anomaly into 4 subgroups : unicornuate uterus with communicating rudimentary horn , noncommunicating horn with cavity present , noncommunicating horn without a cavity , and unicornuate uterus without a rudimentary horn . \\n the unicornuate uterus with rudimentary uterine horn is associated with symptoms , such as dysmenorrhea , hematometra , and endometriosis . \\n the diagnosis of this condition is difficult , and the presenting symptoms can easily be falsely attributed to other disorders . \\n unfortunately , this condition is often an unexpected finding at the time of surgery for ectopic pregnancy or dysmenorrhea . \\n a 43-year - old gravida 1 , para 1 , woman presented for evaluation of right lower quadrant pain . \\n this pain had been present for several years and was noted to be a constant dull ache with intermittent periods of intolerable sharp stabbing pain . \\n her surgical history was significant for a cesarean delivery for breech presentation with postpartum bilateral tubal ligation , transvaginal hysterectomy with tension - free vaginal tape placement , laparoscopic cholecystectomy , dilation and curettage ( twice ) , inguinal hernia repair , and laparoscopic appendectomy . \\n the patient had undergone the transvaginal hysterectomy with ovarian conservation and a tension - free vaginal tape for dysmenorrhea and stress urinary incontinence 3 years before presentation . \\n a preoperative pelvic ultrasound report described a right - sided uterine fibroid measuring 1.1 cm in average diameter . \\n after the hysterectomy , the patient continued to have a dull ache in the right lower quadrant . \\n two years after the hysterectomy , she had an acute exacerbation of her right lower quadrant pain . \\n she was evaluated in the emergency department , and a computed tomographic ( ct ) scan of the abdomen revealed a mass in the right lower quadrant measuring 3.5x2.9 cm . \\n this mass was seen overlying the cecum , and the study was interpreted as being suspicious for appendicitis . \\n intraoperative gynecologic consultation was obtained and a recommendation made for the patient to follow - up postoperatively with a gynecologic oncologist . \\n physical examination findings included a right - sided tender , cystic , mobile adnexal mass . \\n the mass did not fill the cul de sac and was definitely arising from the right side . \\n mri of the pelvis showed a heterogeneous right - sided adnexal mass measuring 4.5 cm in its largest dimension . \\n the rudimentary uterine horn , fallopian tube , and right ovary were removed laparoscopically using bipolar energy and sharp dissection . \\n the rudimentary uterine horn was opened and inspected off of the surgical field and was of the cavitary noncommunicating type . \\n pathologic evaluation of the surgical specimen showed a rudimentary uterine horn with proliferative endometrium and adenomyosis , normal ovary , and endometriosis of the wall of the fallopian tube . \\n she had an uncomplicated postoperative course and 2 months after the procedure continued to be free of pain . \\n uterine anomalies occur infrequently and are therefore not usually thought of in the differential diagnosis in patients with pelvic pain , particularly in a patient who had previously undergone hysterectomy . \\n management of a rudimentary uterine horn consists of laparoscopic removal of the horn and ipsilateral fallopian tube to relieve dysmenorrhea , to prevent endometriosis from retrograde menstruation , and to prevent future rudimentary horn pregnancy . \\n this case illustrates the need for a thoughtful and thorough evaluation of the pelvic organs at the time of laparoscopy or other pelvic operative procedures . \\n uterine anomalies must be considered as a potential source of pelvic pain , especially when the pain occurs in a cyclic fashion .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 642,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"immune checkpoint inhibitors have drastically changed in the treatment of many kinds of malignancies , especially malignant melanoma . \\n the focus of the recent experiments has not only been on their efficacy but also immune -

dimensional volume - rendered series ( 3-d vr ) ( figures 1(b ) and 2(b ) ) . \\n in addition , the data from the mdct study can also be used to generate a translucent display , a computer - generated image set that provides 3-d images of the spine enabling assessment of surgical instrumentation through the bony structures ( figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) . the 3-d vr series , including the translucent display , which are generated by computer manipulation of the axial ct source data without additional radiation , have led to a growth in demand for mdct for the imaging of the spine by the spine surgeons at our institution , a major cancer center . however , to the best of our knowledge , there are no reports in the literature on the use of mdct with the 3-d vr series and the translucent display for evaluation of abnormal spinal curvature , which requires additional time for processing and interpretation . \\n we tested the hypothesis that the 3-d vr series , including the translucent display , provides additional information beyond that of the 2-d orthogonal mdct in the evaluation of abnormal spinal curvature in patients treated at a cancer center . \\n the institutional review board of the university of texas md anderson cancer center approved this study and waived the requirements for an informed consent . \\n mdct studies of the spine in patients who had a history of possible primary or metastatic disease to the spine or neurofibromatosis type 1 and an abnormal spinal curvature greater than 25 degrees , as assessed on mdct , were included in our study . \\n measurements of spinal curvature were made on the 2-d coronal or sagittal reconstructed ct images , as described in the literature [ 4 , 5 ] . \\n the review of the imaging studies and clinical data was performed by 3 neuroradiologists ( jmd , lk , and ngt ) in a consensus fashion . the 3-d vr series , \\n including translucent display , was compared to the 2-d orthogonal mdct studies without the 3-d vr series in the assessment of the following 3 categories : spinal curvature ; bony definition ( deformity , fusion , and destruction ) ; additional findings ( mass lesions , fractures , and instrumentation ) . for each patient , \\n the 3-d vr series was given a score of 1 if it was judged to be \\n helpful  in the evaluation of the aforementioned 3 categories ( 48 patients  3 categories = 144 total possible categories ) and a score of 0 if it was  not helpful  . \\n mdct examinations were performed on a multidetector ct scanner ( ge medical systems ) to yield imaging in the axial plane using the following parameters : 140  kv , 220250  ma , and a 1.25  mm slice thickness . \\n the mdct examinations were performed without ( n = 41 ) , with ( n = 3 ) , or without and with ( n = 4 ) intravenous contrast ( optiray , mallinckrodt inc . , \\n bone algorithm and soft tissue images were available and reviewed in all patients ' mdct studies . \\n postprocessing was then performed by a trained technologist on an advantage aw4.2 workstation ( ge medical systems ) using volume view software ( ge medical systems ) . \\n the post - processing provided imaging in the sagittal and coronal planes in all patients , and these images , together with the axial source images , are hereafter referred to as the 2-d orthogonal mdct study . \\n in addition , 3-d vr images of the spine ( figures 1(b ) and 2(b ) ) and the translucent display ( figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) , for patients in whom surgical instrumentation was placed for the stabilization of abnormal spinal curvature , were provided . \\n the study included 48 patients ( 35 female and 13 male ; ages 1272 , mean age , 48 years ) , as summarized in table 1 . \\n twenty - four patients had a dextroscoliotic curvature measuring between 26 and 93 degrees ( mean , 45.5 ) , 9 patients had a levoscoliotic curvature measuring between 25 and 72 degrees ( mean , 35.2 degrees ) , and 15 patients had a kyphotic curvature of measuring between 27 and 89 degrees ( mean 48.1 degrees ) . \\n twenty - six patients had a 3-d vr series without a transparent display and 22 patients had a 3-d vr series with a transparent display . \\n the 3-d vr series was rated as  helpful  when compared to the 2-d orthogonal mdct study in 38 of 48 ( 79.2% ) patients ; in 10 of 48 ( 20.8% ) patients , the 3-d vr series was rated as  not helpful  . \\n helpful  in 63 of 144 ( 43.8% ) total possible categories ( table 2 ) . \\n this included the assessment of the spinal curvature in 32 of 48 ( 66.7% ) patients , including dextroscoliosis ( n = 16 , 2683 , mean 50.6 ) , levoscoliosis ( n = 8 , 2572 , mean 35.3 ) , and kyphosis ( n = 8 ; 4289 , mean 58.9 ) . \\n the 3-d vr series was rated as  not helpful  in 16 of 48 patients ( 33.3% ) , including those with dextroscoliosis ( n = 8 ; 2949 , mean 35.4 ) , levoscoliosis ( n = 1 , 35 ) , and kyphosis ( n = 7 ; 2747 , mean 35.7 ) . \\n the 3-d vr series was rated as  helpful  in the bone definition category for 14 of 48 ( 29.2% ) patients , including bone deformity ( n = 6 ) , bony fusion ( n = 4 ) , bony destruction ( n = 2 ) , anterolisthesis ( n = 2 ) , and the additional findings category , including surgical instrumentation , in 17 patients , specifically , for the assessment of the fusion rods ( n = 15 ) or an anterior fusion plate and pedicular screws ( n = 2 ) . \\n figure 1 shows 2-d orthogonal mdct and 3-d vr images from patient no . 11 , a 16-year - old male who presented with a kyphotic curvature secondary to a recurrent juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma of the thoracic spinal cord . \\n the 3-d vr images were scored as 1 ,  helpful  in the evaluation of the spinal curvature as the spine is out of plane on 2-d orthogonal mdct imaging . \\n 4 , a 61-year - old woman who underwent correction of an abnormal spinal curvature at an outside institution . \\n the patient had a levoscoliotic curvature of the thoracic spine to such a degree the spinal column and instrumentation could not be visualized as one structure on a single , 2-d orthogonal mdct image . \\n the transparent display was helpful in demonstrating the scoliotic curvature and the position and integrity of the instrumentation . \\n helpful  in comparison to the corresponding 2-d orthogonal mdct in the assessment of abnormal spinal curvature in 38 of 48 patients , specifically in the evaluation of abnormal curvature in 32 patients , bony definition in 14 patients , and additional findings , including surgical instrumentation , in 17 patients . \\n these findings confirm our hypothesis that the 3-d vr series , including the translucent display , is of additional benefit in the assessment of abnormal spinal curvature in patients treated at a major cancer center . as not all patients had abnormalities in each of the 3 categories , that is , surgical instrumentation , \\n the percentage of cases where the 3-d vr was helpful is likely higher than what we report , further supporting our hypothesis . \\n when reviewing an mdct study of abnormal spinal curvature , the 3-d vr series can be assessed before the 2-d orthogonal mdct study . as the spinal deformity in these patients is often out of the plane of imaging on a single , 2-d orthogonal mdct image ( figures 1(a ) and 2(a ) ) , the 3-d vr sequence provides comprehensive assessment of the entire spine on a single 3-d image ; this image can then be rotated and viewed from 360 degrees . in our study , we found this more beneficial in patients with a greater degree of dextroscoliotic than kyphotic curvature and more helpful for a greater degree of abnormal spinal curvature . \\n not only can the 3-d vr series evaluate the shape of the spine , but also aid in the detection of a rotatory component , anterolisthesis , and the apex of the curvature . \\n in addition , with the 3-d vr series , the number of vertebral bodies can be counted in a single view ; this assures that the numbering assignment will be correct if an anomalous number of spinal segments are present . \\n this is more difficult to determine on orthogonal 2-d mdct as the spine is often out of the plane of imaging due to the spinal curvature . \\n the 3-d vr series can also evaluate the vertebral bodies for evidence of dysplasia , fracture , or bony destruction . \\n previous authors [ 1012 ] have demonstrated that ct is better than plain radiographs for the evaluation of spine abnormalities . \\n state that when a complex osseous deformity is present , radiographs are inadequate for complete evaluation and the use of ct is mandatory , especially when surgery is planned . \\n our result takes this evaluation as a step further and demonstrate that the 3-d vr series would benefit 2-d orthogonal mdct in the evaluation of vertebral anomalies as the 14 studies scored a  helpful \\n rating in the evaluation of the bony structures , including 4 cases with prior surgical bony fusion .   in the post - operative patient \\n , the 3-d vr series with translucent display may be used to assess surgical instrumentation . \\n this technique allows the visualization of the instrumentation through the bone and can also be rotated and viewed in 360 degrees , including in oblique planes . as the surgical instrumentation is visualized as one component on a single image , and the position and integrity of support rods and pedicular screws are assessed , \\n coloring of the spinal instrumentation is also possible ( figure 2(d ) ) . in every case with surgical instrumentation in our study , \\n in fact , our referring spine surgeons insist on inclusion of the 3-d vr series for the evaluation of the spine and the transparent display for a comprehensive overview of the surgical instrumentation . \\n further study can be undertaken to determine if the 3-d vr series with translucent display can be used to evaluate surgical instrumentation following spinal surgery in the general population with an abnormal spinal curvature and to evaluate associated complications . \\n as recent advances in mdct technology have led to a significant reduction in streak artifact related to metallic hardware [ 13 , 14 ] . \\n mdct with vr series may lead to better evaluation of the postoperative spine and possibly easier detection of complications . \\n it should be noted , though , that the interpreting radiologist must be careful not to mistake streak artifact that extends through the surgical instrumentation of the breakage of hardware . \\n the purpose of this study was to determine if the 3-d vr images provide additional information to the orthogonal 2-d mdct dataset and the results support our hypothesis . \\n we are not suggesting that 3-d vr can replace the orthogonal 2-d mdct ; rather 3-d vr is complementary . \\n one limitation of the study is that this is a very select group of patients , mainly those presenting for treatment of their disease to a major cancer center . \\n computed tomography has been described in the measurement of scoliosis , including the rotatory component [ 1519 ] . \\n further study will be necessary to determine if the 3-d vr series can be for evaluation and measurement of abnormal curvature in the general population , including for idiopathic scoliosis . \\n one negative aspect of mdct is that patients are imaged in the recumbent position and the use of ionizing radiation . \\n the downside of patient positioning also applies to the reconstructed 3-d vr series ; however , no addition radiation is necessary for computer generation of the 3-d vr series or the translucent display . \\n herein , we have illustrated the added benefit of 3-d vr imaging and the translucent display to axial and 2-d orthogonal mdct imaging of the spine for the evaluation of abnormal spinal curvature among patients at a major cancer center . \\n failure to recognize the etiology of spinal curvature , such as syndromic deformities , fractures , or malignancies of the spine , can affect treatment and management outcomes for patients . \\n the translucent display series provides a more comprehensive evaluation of surgical instrumentation following correction of an abnormal spinal curvature or resection of malignancy . \\n it is , therefore , beneficial for spine surgeons and radiologists involved in the care of patients with abnormal spinal curvature to be aware of the benefits of the 3-d vr series and the translucent display .\",\n          \"perforation of the biliary system occurs \\n most frequently in the gallbladder , usually associated with ( and complicating \\n upto 10% cases of ) acute cholecystitis . \\n perforation of the extrahepatic biliary \\n tree is a rare entity , accounting for less than 10% of intraperitoneal biliary \\n rupture . \\n bile duct perforation is most commonly described in infants related to congenital \\n biliary system anomalies . \\n aetiology in the adult is commonly attributable to \\n intramural infection , necrosis of the wall of the bile duct secondary to \\n thrombosis , increased intraductal pressure secondary to obstruction , cirrhosis , \\n and direct erosion by calculi . \\n overall , 70% of cases are related to calculi \\n . the incidence of biliary tract disease during pregnancy ranges from 0.050.3% . despite these apparent low \\n figures , complications from gallstones \\n represent the most common general surgical condition \\n requiring surgical intervention , second only to appendicitis . \\n indications for intervention of gallstones during pregnancy \\n include obstructive jaundice , acute cholecystitis , or pancreatitis failing \\n medical management . \\n we present the case of a young woman diagnosed with \\n gallstones in late pregnancy , complicated by acute gallstone pancreatitis and \\n subsequently spontaneous common bile duct perforation . \\n a twenty - year - old primigravida woman was \\n planned for elective caesarean section due to breech presentation . \\n the patient \\n had a past medical history of -thalassemia trait , but was not \\n normally on regular medication . \\n her mother had previously undergone a \\n cholecystectomy for gallstones . at 34 weeks gestation , she presented \\n acutely with a two - week history of worsening abdominal pain localised to the \\n epigastric region , associated with vomiting . on examination , \\n blood results revealed raised inflammatory markers ( wbc 14.4 [ 4.011.0 ] , \\n neutrophils 11.9 [ 2.07.5 ] , crp 60 \\n [ 07.5 ] ) and evidence of pancreatitis ( amylase 1369 \\n iu / l [ 36128 ] ) , mildly \\n raised bilirubin ( 24 mol / l [ 020 ] ) and raised alkaline phosphatase ( 183 \\n an abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple small gallstones and a \\n thickened gallbladder wall , but no evidence of a dilated intra or extrahepatic \\n biliary system . \\n the patient was treated conservatively , rapidly improved , and liver function tests \\n normalised . \\n an emergency caesarean \\n section was performed and a term baby delivered , but no obvious cause was found \\n to explain her clinical condition . \\n the following day her clinical condition worsened , with progressive abdominal pain \\n and a metabolic acidosis . \\n she required aggressive resuscitation , inotropic , and ventilatory support and was , \\n therefore , admitted to the intensive care unit . \\n a computed tomography ( ct ) \\n revealed extensive free peritoneal fluid and gas of which the aetiology was not \\n apparent . \\n the patient underwent a prompt laparotomy and was found to have \\n generalised biliary peritonitis . \\n the gallbladder was intact but a 2 mm \\n perforation was found on the anterior surface of a dilated common \\n bile duct ( 12 mm ) . on table \\n cholangiography suggested obstruction of the distal \\n common bile duct caused by a 5 mm gallstone impacted within the distal common \\n bile duct . \\n the calculus was removed , and the duct was repaired over a t - tube . \\n a t - tube cholangiogram was performed \\n after 4 weeks , and the tube was uneventfully removed ( figure 1 ) . \\n although the pathogenesis of spontaneous biliary perforation is poorly understood , \\n recognised mechanisms include the following : calculous perforation at the site \\n of impaction ; calculous erosion without impaction ; increased canalicular \\n pressure due to obstruction by tumour , stone , or spasm of the sphincter of \\n oddi ; intramural infection ; mural vessel infarction leading to mural necrosis ; \\n or rupture of a biliary tract anomaly such as cyst or diverticulum . \\n thus , \\n because perforation of the biliary system is a recognised complication of \\n cholelithiasis , the diagnosis should be suspected if a perihepatic abscess or \\n peritonitis is combined with biliary stone disease . as early as 1882 , freeland   reported the first case of extrahepatic biliary system rupture in an adult ( diagnosed at autopsy ) , an entity that was \\n subsequently first described in pregnancy by piotrowski et al .   over a \\n century later . since this time , \\n very few cases of spontaneous common bile duct \\n perforation in adults have been reported in the literature , with cases \\n occurring during pregnancy being even more scarce . \\n the importance of this clinical \\n scenario lies in the potential serious morbidity and not infrequent mortality \\n associated with missed biliary system perforation . \\n petrozza \\n et al .   described two cases of gallbladder perforation due to cholelithiasis in \\n the early postpartum period . \\n both cases presented a diagnostic dilemma , and it \\n was concluded that a history of cholelithiasis in a patient with persistent \\n intra - abdominal symptoms in the postpartum period must alert to prompt \\n investigation and early management . \\n , \\n one patient was found to have suffered gallbladder rupture as a result of \\n cholecystitis , and in the second , a common bile duct perforation was found at \\n laparotomy with no obvious precipitating cause . \\n .   also drew \\n attention to the similarity of symptoms of gallbladder disease in pregnancy to \\n mild pre - eclampsia , having in common hypertension , epigastric pain , and mildly \\n deranged liver function tests . \\n these cases highlight the importance of \\n recognising the possibility of delayed diagnosis of cholelithiasis as a result \\n of nonspecific abdominal symptoms during pregnancy and indicate early \\n investigation and treatment in order to reduce serious morbidity . \\n . \\n block and kelly   reported the optimum time for surgical management of \\n gallstone pancreatitis to be in the second trimester or early postpartum \\n period , in order to minimise maternal / fetal mortality and recurrent \\n pancreatitis . \\n unfortunately , in those women presenting \\n late in pregnancy ( as in the case described ) , the balance of risk favours \\n watchful waiting until after delivery followed by elective cholecystectomy . \\n certainly , this risks early recurrence of acute pancreatitis , as well as rare but severe \\n consequences such as biliary peritonitis . \\n whether an early endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography ( ercp ) \\n and sphincterotomy in those cases presenting with gallstone pancreatitis can be \\n an acceptable temporary preventive measure is unclear , but undertaking ercp is \\n not without risk , and the potential risks should be considered carefully in \\n individual cases . in this particular case , \\n it is impossible to know whether the eroding calculus had been present during the \\n initial episode of pancreatitis . \\n magnetic resonance scanning is a commonly used \\n imaging modality in obstetrics , considered to be safe and avoiding the use of \\n ionising radiation . \\n therefore , magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography \\n ( mrcp ) would have been a reasonable next investigation during this patient s \\n initial presentation , and if a ductal stone had been revealed , then the indication \\n for ercp may have been clearer . \\n on the other hand , neonatal and postnatal \\n care of babies born early have progressed significantly , suggesting the \\n possibility of induction of labour perhaps at 3638 weeks \\n gestation in severely symptomatic or high - risk patients . \\n of course , every case \\n must be considered individually , taking into account maternal and fetal \\n history and health .\",\n          \"musicians often experience musculoskeletal pain as a result of lengthy and long - term \\n instrument performance . \\n more students enrolled in music schools note upper limb pain \\n compared with students enrolled in ordinary schools1 . \\n it has also been reported that the incidence of upper limb pain is \\n higher in those who have longer practice times . \\n therefore , it can be said that upper limb \\n pain in musicians is a symptom of overuse , with lengthy and long - term instrument performance \\n being contributing factors . \\n musculoskeletal pain in musicians is common not only in the \\n upper limbs but also in the lumbar and cervical regions , as well as in the shoulder \\n girdle2 . \\n for example , it is conceivable that when playing a heavy instrument \\n such as the tuba , a large load is applied to the trunk to maintain the performance posture . \\n furthermore , as instruments in a marching band are played while marching , a large load is \\n probably also applied to the lower limbs . \\n however , the performance postures \\n of various types of instruments have not been sufficiently investigated . \\n thus , the present \\n study clarified the characteristics of the standing performance posture for the trumpet and \\n the marching euphonium and investigated the effect of the performance postures of these \\n instruments on the lower limb musculoskeletal system . \\n the subjects were 10 female university students in japan . their ( mean  sd ) age was 20.5  \\n 1.3  years , their height was 159.6  6.2  cm , and their weight was 55.1  7.2  kg . \\n because the subjects were not \\n professional trumpet or marching euphonium performers , they all received sufficient \\n instruction from the instructor regarding the trumpet and marching euphonium performance \\n posture prior to measurements . \\n the purpose and contents of the study were sufficiently \\n explained to the subjects , whose consent to participate in the study was obtained . \\n additionally , approval was obtained from the shijonawate gakuen university ethics committee \\n ( approval number 23 - 2 ) . \\n the subjects adopted a closed - leg resting standing position , a trumpet performance posture , \\n and a marching euphonium performance posture . \\n all instrumental performance postures were \\n adopted in the standing , and the subjects focused directly ahead on a mark positioned at eye \\n level . subjects maintained performance posture without actually playing the instrument . \\n the \\n angle and muscle activity of the trunk and lower limbs were measured while the postures were \\n maintained . \\n the measurement was performed in the sequence of the resting standing position , \\n the trumpet performance posture , and the marching euphonium performance posture . \\n the trunk \\n and lower limb angles were measured using a three - dimensional motion analysis device \\n ( cms - hs , zebris medical gmbh , isny , germany ) . \\n markers were attached to the lateral \\n malleolus , lateral epicondyle of the femur , greater trochanter , and acromion on the left \\n side of the subjects . \\n the sampling frequency was 100  hz , and the measurement time was 10 s. \\n measurements were performed as soon as the subjects could maintain a stable performance \\n posture . \\n the collected data were processed by image analysis software ( win - date , zebris \\n medical gmbh ) , and the angles of knee flexion , hip flexion , and anterior tilt of the trunk \\n were calculated . \\n the angle of knee flexion was considered as the angle formed between the \\n line linking the lateral malleolus and the lateral epicondyle of the femur and the line \\n linking the lateral epicondyle of the femur and the greater trochanter . \\n the angle of hip \\n flexion was considered as the angle formed between the line linking the lateral epicondyle \\n of the femur and the greater trochanter and a vertical line . \\n the anterior tilt angle of the \\n trunk was considered as the angle formed between the line linking the acromion and the \\n greater trochanter and a vertical line . a surface myograph ( myosystem 1200 , noraxon inc . , \\n the muscle activities measured \\n were those of the cervical paraspinal muscles , upper fibers of the trapezius , lumbar \\n paraspinal muscles , gluteus maximus , rectus femoris , biceps femoris , and lateral head of the \\n gastrocnemius on the left side . \\n after treating the skin sufficiently to create a skin \\n resistance of no greater than 10  , electrodes ( blue sensor p-00-s , ambu a / s , ballerup , \\n denmark ) were attached parallel to the muscle fibers at the center of each muscle . \\n spacing between the electrodes was 25  mm , the \\n sampling frequency was 1,000  hz , and the sampling time was 10 s. measurements were performed \\n as soon as subjects could maintain a stable performance posture . \\n the collected data were \\n subjected to full - wave rectification using electromyogram analysis software ( myoresearch , \\n noraxon inc . ) , and the average amplitude of the central three seconds was determined . \\n the \\n average amplitude of each muscle was normalized as 100% according to the average amplitude \\n of the 3-s maximum voluntary contraction . \\n statistical analysis entailed a one -

in posture  and is \\n considered a posture in which the muscle activity in the cervical area including the \\n cervical paraspinal muscles increases6 . \\n sustained contraction of these muscles is a likely factor of muscle fatigue . \\n furthermore , \\n obstruction of blood flow by sustained muscle contraction will result in myalgia7 . \\n therefore , holding the trumpet and marching \\n euphonium performance postures for a long time would be factors of myalgia . \\n the present findings suggest that the trumpet and marching euphonium performance postures \\n increase the load on the cervical and trunk musculoskeletal system . \\n moreover , the load on \\n the musculoskeletal system increases in line with increased instrument weight . \\n however , the \\n trumpet and marching euphonium performance postures do not affect the musculoskeletal system \\n of the lower limbs . \\n therefore , we consider it important to evaluate the cervical and trunk \\n musculoskeletal systems and to conduct conditioning coaching appropriate for trumpet and \\n marching euphonium performers . \\n because these instruments are supported by the left hand and \\n played with the right hand , the trunk and lower limb musculoskeletal system on the left \\n side , that is , the supporting side , was measured in the present study . \\n we plan to measure \\n the trunk and lower limb musculoskeletal system on the right side to elucidate the effect of \\n performance postures on the whole body . \\n in addition , it is possible that the trunk and lower \\n limb musculoskeletal system is affected differently by the technique used to hold the \\n instrument with the left hand during trumpet and the marching euphonium performance . because \\n the angles and muscle activities of the upper arm were not measured in the present study , we \\n plan to perform these measurements in a future study to elucidate the influence of different \\n instrument holding techniques on the trunk and lower limb musculoskeletal systems .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1125,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"background . \\n abnormal spinal curvature is routinely assessed with plain radiographs , mdct , and mri . \\n mdct can provide two -

old male presented in our hospital at m.m . institute of medical sciences and research ( mmimsr ) , mullana , ambala , haryana , india in may 2013 ; he had accidentally swallowed a toothbrush two months back and there was a history of epigastric discomfort especially after meals . however , the vital signs were within normal limits and the abdomen was soft and nontender . \\n x - ray of the abdomen suggested the presence of a foreign body and a computed tomography ( ct ) scan was done which confirmed a toothbrush lying in the stomach [ figures 1 , 2 ] . \\n an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was done which revealed the toothbrush in the stomach with its head toward the gastroduodenal junction . \\n biopsy forceps were used to deliver the toothbrush by holding its bristles [ figure 3 ] . \\n the endoscope was kept inside to insufflate and distend the stomach and a minilaparotomy with gastrotomy of 1.5 - 2 cm was performed through the midline under local anesthesia and the toothbrush was successfully removed . \\n x - ray of the abdomen suggesting the presence of the toothbrush in the abdomen computed tomography ( ct ) scan of the abdomen showing the presence of the toothbrush in the tomach endoscopic picture of toothbrush with biopsy forceps in situ to retrieve it from the stomach \\n in the stomach , 80 - 90% of foreign bodies pass uneventfully through the gastrointestinal tract without complications . \\n however , objects longer than 10 cm like a toothbrush can not negotiate the duodenal c - loop due to its fixed position in the retroperitoneum , and these must be removed as soon as possible to avoid pressure necrosis and gastric perforation . \\n more than 40 cases of toothbrush ingestion have been reported in the literature till date . \\n however , extreme caution and experience of the endoscopist is required for such procedures . in failed cases of endoscopic removal , \\n however , we devised a simple technique of minilaparotomy and gastrotomy under local anesthesia for removing such foreign bodies . in this technique , \\n the stomach is distended with the help of air insufflation through the endoscope and a small incision is made in the midepigasrium under local anesthesia and the foreign object can be removed directly under the vision of the endoscope . \\n a swallowed toothbrush is a rare occurrence and it never passes through the gastrointestinal tract spontaneously . \\n early removal of the toothbrush is critical for reducing morbidity and mortality . in cases where endoscopic removal fails , \\n endoscopy still remains an aid in performing surgical gastrotomy for delivering such complex foreign bodies under local anesthesia .\",\n          \"a 75-year - old man with a slightly increased serum creatinine level had developed proteinuria and hypertension in 2000 . in 2007 , he noticed a gradually progressive hearing loss and repeated bloody nasal discharge resulting from a refractory sinusitis . \\n initial laboratory findings revealed elevated serine proteinase 3-anti - neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( pr3-anca ; 26.2 eu ) , blood urea nitrogen ( 35 mg / dl ) , and serum creatinine ( 1.62 mg / dl ) levels . \\n because of these combined findings , he was diagnosed as having granulomatosis with polyangiitis ( gpa ) according to the american college of rheumatology 1990 criteria for gpa and watts algorithm [ 1 , 2 ] . \\n the birmingham vasculitis activity score 2003 was 6 . because of the low disease activity , the slow progression and the advanced age \\n , we did not initiate immunosuppressive therapy at this time . in october 2008 , he developed fever lasting for several days . \\n laboratory data were as follows : c - reactive protein 11.91 mg / dl , pr3-anca 49.1 u / ml , fibrinogen 752 mg / dl , d - dimer 1.7 g / ml , and urinary protein 0.27 g / day . \\n activated partial thromboplastin time , prothrombin time and fibrin degradation product were within the respective normal range . \\n although we administered meropenem ( 2.0 g / day for 1 week ) , vancomycin ( 500 mg / day for 17 days ) and itraconazole ( 200 mg / day for 20 days ) , the fever and c - reactive protein level did not decrease . on day 12 of admission \\n a brain mri revealed a mass lesion in the right frontal lobe and hypertrophic mucosa in the paranasal sinuses ( fig . \\n 1a ) in addition to a thickened and strongly enhanced dura mater surrounding the mass lesion ( fig . \\n however , he rapidly developed left hemiparesis and deterioration of consciousness [ glasgow coma scale ( gcs ) : e1v2m4 ] . \\n a brain ct revealed that the parenchymal mass lesion had enlarged and the mucous effusion was invading the posterior wall of the right frontal sinus . \\n due to an impending transtentorial herniation , a decompressive hemicraniectomy and partial right frontal lobectomy were performed , which moderately improved his consciousness ( gcs : e2v3m4 ) . \\n after the surgery , he developed bloody sputa , and a chest ct revealed an infiltrative shadow in both lungs . \\n the biopsied brain material from the surgery revealed a granulomatous inflammation with geographic necrosis and multinucleated giant cells in the perivascular area of the thickened dura mater and leptomeninges ( fig . \\n small vessels in the meninges were involved in the granulomatous lesions , and the lumens of the veins were often occluded . in the cerebral cortices and the white matter in these areas , hemorrhagic infarction was widely observed . \\n after treatment with prednisolone ( 20 mg / day ) and azathioprine ( 40 mg / day ) , the disturbance of consciousness substantially improved ( gcs : e4v3m5 ) , and the epistaxis stopped . \\n this study was conducted with the approval of the ethics committee of niigata university graduate school of medical and dental sciences . \\n cns involvement such as pachymeningitis and cerebrovascular events is uncommon in gpa , reported in only 28% of cases [ 3 , 4 ] . \\n we previously clarified that leptomeningeal and parenchymal involvement in the brain were significantly more common in pr3-anca - positive hypertrophic pachymeningitis compared to myeloperoxidase anti - neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody - positive and idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis in a study of 36 patients ( including this case ) . \\n based on the study , mri findings showed an enhancement of both the pachymeninges and leptomeninges . \\n moreover , the present case had the extension of the mass lesion with the granulomatous inflammation , and the venous obstruction resulted in severe edema and hemorrhagic infarction . \\n emergency decompressive craniectomy and partial lobectomy for cerebral infarction with gpa likely contributed to our patient 's survival . to our knowledge , this is the first report successfully managed with surgical decompressive craniectomy . \\n \",\n          \"macroscopically , renal cell carcinomas ( rccs ) generally present as either solid or cystic mass . among cystic rccs , \\n multilocular cystic rcc represents a rare entity that was recognized in 1982 , with a reported incidence of 1 - 4% of all rccs . \\n renal leiomyomas are benign tumors of the kidney originating from smooth muscle cells of the renal capsule , pelvis , calices , or blood vessels . \\n although small renal leiomyomas can be found in about 5% of autopsy specimens , clinical incidence of these lesions is much lower . in this report , we discuss the first case of simultaneous occurrence of a multilocular cystic rcc and a leiomyoma in the same kidney . \\n a 38-year - old man was referred for treatment of a right renal cystic mass found incidentally . \\n physical examination on admission revealed no palpable mass , and laboratory data were negative . computed tomography of the abdomen showed a about 5.4  4.6 cm poorly enhancing cystic mass with enhancing septa in the polar area of the right kidney ( fig . \\n since multilocular cystic rcc could not be excluded , the patient underwent right laparoscopic radical nephrectomy . \\n macroscopically , in the mid pole , a well - circumscribed mass showing a multicystic feature with thin fibrous septa and without expansile tumor nodules was noted . \\n rccs show cystic changes on imaging studies in 4 - 15% of cases [ 4 , 5 ] . \\n since it is often difficult to differentiate cystic rccs from benign cystic lesions , a definite diagnosis can in most cases only be established by histopathologic examination . \\n these include : ( 1 ) intrinsic multiloculated growth ; ( 2 ) intrinsic unilocular growth ; ( 3 ) cystic necrosis , and ( 4 ) origin from the epithelial lining in a pre - existing cyst . \\n because multilocular cystic rcc are more likely to be discovered incidentally , this feature may contribute to their excellent prognosis compared to that of conventional rccs . \\n since the majority of rccs originate from the proximal tubules , the characteristics and/or environment of the proximal tubules are considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of rcc . \\n recently , imura et al . carried out a detailed immunohistochemical analysis of multilocular cystic rcc cases . \\n they found that in a high proportion of cases , multilocular cystic rcc reacted strongly with the distal nephron markers , but none reacted preferentially with proximal nephron markers . \\n these results illustrate that multilocular cystic rcc originates from the distal nephron , although the precise pathogenesis of cystic formation in multilocular cystic rcc has not been elucidated clearly . \\n renal leiomyomas are benign tumors arising from the mesenchymal ( or connective ) tissue of the kidney . \\n tumors may be subcapsular ( 53% ) , capsular ( 37% ) , or located in the renal pelvis ( 10% ) . \\n a variety of structural patterns have been described at imaging : solid , cystic , and both cystic and solid [ 9 , 10 ] . in 1990 , steiner et al . \\n the first group comprises small cortical or subcortical neoplasms that are usually asymptomatic , less than 2 cm in size , and are often detected incidentally during autopsy or surgery . \\n the second group consists of larger neoplasms that arise from the renal capsule or blood vessels and may be symptomatic . unfortunately , it is almost impossible to clinically distinguish renal leiomyomas from their malignant counterparts . because of their small size ( usually less than 2 cm ) , these smooth muscle - containing tumors are commonly diagnosed during autopsy , and clinical manifestations become apparent only when they grow larger , hemorrhage , or undergo cystic or sarcomatous degeneration . since the finding of primary synchronous renal neoplasms is very uncommon , especially when they have a different histogenesis , up to now , only a few primary , synchronous rccs with different histotypes have been reported . the coexistence of multilocular cystic rcc and leiomyoma has not been documented . \\n this present case is the first report of synchronous renal neoplasms with different histogenesis ( multilocular cystic rcc and leiomyoma ) in a patient without any symptoms . \\n the significance of the relationship between multilocular cystic rccs and leiomyomas is not well understood and needs further exploration .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 74,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"most of the ingested foreign bodies pass uneventfully through the gastrointestinal tract . however , long and rigid foreign bodies are associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal impaction , perforation , and bleeding . spontaneous passage of a toothbrush has not been reported till date and the technique of its removal is a curiosity for surgeons . \\n endoscopy is a recommended technique for the removal of such complex foreign bodies . \\n however , if it fails , the foreign body can be removed successfully with a laparoscopic gastrotomy . \\n we devised an innovative technique by using pneumatic gastric insufflation and extracted the toothbrush by a tiny gastrotomy under local anesthesia .\",\n          \"central nervous system ( cns ) involvement , such as pachymeningitis and/or cerebrovascular events , is rare in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis ( gpa ) . \\n furthermore , the details of pathological examinations of cases have rarely been described . \\n we describe a case of gpa that manifested as an isolated paranasal sinus disease that invaded the subarachnoid space and caused a hemorrhagic venous infarction . \\n we also describe the pathological characteristics of the biopsied brain material from the successful decompressive craniectomy . \\n in particular , granulomatous inflammation with geographic necrosis and multinucleated giant cells were observed in the perivascular area of the thickened dura mater and leptomeninges . \\n small vessels in the meninges were involved in the granulomatous lesions , and the lumens of the veins were often occluded . in the cerebral cortices and white matter in these areas , \\n hemorrhagic infarction was widely observed . \\n we suggest that our findings represent a novel mechanism of cns involvement in gpa . \\n moreover , we believe that the emergency decompressive craniectomy and partial lobectomy for the cerebral infarction in this patient with gpa likely contributed to his survival .\",\n          \"we present an unusual case of concurrent occurrence of a multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma and a leiomyoma in the same kidney of a patient with no evident clinical symptoms . \\n a 38-year -

old female was referred to our hospital with idiopathic erm of the left eye in july 2003 . her visual acuity was 1.2 in the unaffected right eye and 0.1 with marked distortion in the left eye . \\n a fundus examination of the left eye revealed a distinct erm , but pvd was not confirmed ( fig . \\n 1a ) . optical coherence tomography ( oct ) demonstrated a partially rolled - up erm , diffuse retinal thickening , and the absence of foveal pit ( fig . \\n when she was admitted to our hospital for surgery 1 month later , her visual acuity had improved to 0.5 . \\n a fundus examination showed that pvd had occurred and erm had spontaneously resolved with minimal retinal folds remaining ( fig . \\n her diagnosis was resolution of the idiopathic erm , which had occurred subsequently to pvd , and we decided to continue observing the patient without surgery . \\n a fundus examination revealed a semi - transparent erm with a size of about 2 disk diameters ( fig . \\n an oct scan demonstrated macular thickening with areas of hyporeflective intraretinal cystic spaces and an undulating retinal surface ( fig . \\n a microscopic examination of the excised specimen showed the characteristic undulating internal limiting membrane ( ilm ) and a continuous sheet of cells overlying the inner surface of the ilm ( fig . \\n the mechanism of recurrent erm after spontaneous or surgical removal of idiopathic erm is still poorly understood [ 3 , 4 ] . \\n one possible cause is that the retinal glial cells might migrate and proliferate on the inner retinal surface through the fine defects of the ilm that developed following spontaneous or surgical removal . \\n another hypothesis is that idiopathic erm removal is incomplete and focal erm remains attached to ilm . \\n such membrane remnants of idiopathic erm left on the ilm might proliferate and form a new erm . \\n it is reported that ilm removal during surgery for erm is associated with a better final vision and a lower risk of recurrent erm . \\n conservative observation is advocated for young subjects with idiopathic erm associated with mild visual disturbance , as spontaneous resolution of idiopathic erm may occur . but physicians should explain to patients the possibility of recurrence , even if idiopathic erm separates spontaneously .\",\n          \"superior vena cava ( svc ) obstruction of acute onset is uncommon after cardiac surgery . \\n text : a two year old male child was hospitalized with chief complaints of repeated lower respiratory tract infections and poor weight gain . physical examination revealed a pan - systolic murmur on left parasternal border . \\n the echocardiography showed a single , 9 mm perimembranous defect and mild pulmonary valvular stenosis . \\n the pericardium was opened to the right of the midline such that a patch could be harvested for widening of pulmonary annulus , if required . \\n the hegar 's dilator of 17 mm easily passed across the pulmonary valve abating the need of a right ventricular outflow tract repair . \\n the child was weaned off bypass and pericardium was closed over the heart . his hemodynamic parameters including the arterial pressure and central venous pressure ( cvp ) were within normal range during chest closure and shifting to the recovery bed . \\n post operatively , cvp started rising slowly and it reached up to 20 millimetres of mercury in two hours . the face became puffy and appreciable oedema was noticed over the eyelids within next 12 hours . \\n ct was done to find out the cause of obstruction which showed acute narrowing of svc at its entry into right atrium [ figure 2 ] . \\n svc ( superirvenacava ) , ra ( right atrium ) computed tomography scan showing narrowing of superior venacavaat its entry into right atrium the child was taken up for re - exploration and the sternum was reopened . \\n an obvious kinking of svc was seen at its entry into the right atrium due to tight closure of pericardium [ figure 3 ] . \\n as soon as the pericardial sutures were cut , the pressure in svc fell dramatically from 22 to 12 mm [ figure 4 ] . the innominate vein and svc became soft . \\n svc ( superirvenacava ) , in ( innominate vein ) after cutting open pericardial sutures . \\n svc ( superior venacava ) , in ( innominate vein ) , ra ( right atrium ) , ao ( aorta ) \\n the most common cause in the recent era is acute thrombotic occlusion of svc following central venous catheterisation . \\n incidence following cardiac surgery are very low in number ; however , cases are reported about acute svc obstruction after the repair of sinus venosus atrial septal defect and the senning 's repair for transposion of great arteries . \\n direct cannulation of the scv and closure of the hole by purse - string may cause svc obstruction . in the present article case , \\n tight closure of the pericardium caused the obstruction of the svc which led to acute svc syndrome . \\n acute svc obstruction presents as dyspnoea , swelling of face , neck and upper extremity , and engorgement of neck and facial veins . in the present article , \\n the cvp was within normal limits immediately after surgery , and this may be because of the hypovolemia related to surgery . with the volume replacement in recovery unit after surgery , the cvp rose and stayed at higher level due to obstruction in svc . \\n echocardiography is a non - invasive and first modality of investigation which can diagnose the condition along with possible aetiologies . \\n ct scan gives the objective evidence and cause of svc obstruction . in the present case , \\n both echocardiography and ct scan were helpful in diagnosing the condition ; however , failed to provide the aetiology . \\n though surgical repair is the gold standard in the treatment of acute svc obstruction , it can also be treated with covered stent or balloon dilatation . in the present article \\n , we found that the tight pericardium was obstructing the scv flow and simply , cutting open of the pericardium relieved the obstruction . \\n this case demonstrates an unusual post operative course of events and physical findings in which the causative factor for acute svc obstruction was tight pericardial closure .\",\n          \"systemic dehydration and diffuse central nervous system ( cns ) signs without any other illness is referred to as dehydration encephalopathy ( de ) , with disturbed consciousness being the main clinical feature . \\n herein we investigate the incidence of de among persons with disturbed consciousness of various etiologies who visited the emergency unit at our university hospital . \\n we reviewed the emergency medical case records during a 6-month period ( from january to june , 2010 ) . among them , 132 patients presented with disturbed consciousness as the sole initial manifestation on arrival . \\n they were 75 men , 47 women ; mean age 68 years ( 1695 years ) ; 126 arriving by ambulance , 6 by car . \\n we performed the initial work -

related bacteremia in a report from secondary care hospital in durango , mxico [ 3 , 4 ] . \\n biofilm is mainly made of polysaccharide component ; it seems to be the most important factor by which se adheres to and colonizes artificial materials ( catheters ) commonly implanted in patients with ni . \\n biofilm is believed to make clinical se strains more resistant to administered antibiotics and to host defense mechanisms and highly contributed to cause ni in patients [ 2 , 59 ] .   in clinical practice , \\n se has become one of the most significant species among methicillin - resistant coagulase negative staphylococci ( cons ) . \\n there are various scientific world reports that stated that approximately between 80% and 90% of se strains isolated from patients with ni carried the meca gene [ 1013 ] . \\n the presence of meca gene seems to be enhanced in biofilm producers and enable se strains to show increasing resistance to different groups of antibiotics [ 14 , 15 ] . in a university hospital at monterrey , mexico , \\n staphylococci methicillin - resistant strains were detected by molecular methods , and se was the most common species identified . \\n a general hospital of mexico city performs a series of molecular tests to determine icaa gene and consequently biofilm production from staphylococci isolates and research findings here show that se biofilm producers were the most common species found . actually , there are only few hospital reports that express the genuine situation of se infections in mexico , which means that more research is required to understand the real scenario about ni in other hospitals , especially in mexico city , which is one of the biggest and crowdest cities in the world . \\n the aim of the present study is the phenotypic and genotypic characterization related to biofilm production , methicillin and other antibiotic resistance patterns to se strains isolated from ni in a tertiary - care - level hospital in mexico city . \\n a total of 245 strains were isolated from patients with ni from a tertiary - care - level hospital during a four - year period ( 20062010 ) . \\n the biotype and antibiotype for seventeen antimicrobial agents were performed by an automated micro scan system ( american micro scan , mahwah , nj ) , using a specific panel set ( positive bp combo 20 ; dade behring , sacramento , ca . ) as follows : amoxicillin / clavulanic acid  amc ,  ampicillin  amp ,  cefazolin  kz , \\n ctx  , ciprofloxacin  cip  , clindamycin  da ,  chloramphenicol  c ,  erythromycin  e ,  gentamicin  cn ,  imipenem \\n these antibiotics above represent common antibiotics used in mexican hospitals . all strains in this study \\n pcr assay was performed for all 245 se strains searching an amplification product of 458  bp that represent a fragment of meca gene . \\n the primers were designed for meca gene by our group using a primer3 free software ( http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/ ) and the information available in genbank / ncbi ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ) to genome sequence for se strain rp62a ( accession nc_002976 ) the primer sequences for meca gene were compared with other staphylococci genomes using the blast algorithm ( http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi ) then our pcr primers were considered specific to this gene . \\n ten to twenty colonies of each se isolate grown on bhi agar plates were suspended in 250 l of lysis buffer solution ( 0.01  m tris - hcl sigma - aldrich , co. st . \\n louis mo ; lysozyme ( 200  g / ml ; sigma - aldrich , co. , st . \\n louis mo ) and lysostaphine ( 20  g / ml ; sigma - aldrich , co. , st . \\n louis mo ) ) ; this bacterial suspension was incubated at 37c during 90 minutes then after the samples were warmed up at 95c for 10 minutes and finally were centrifuged at 8000  g ( spectrafuge 16  m , labnet international , inc . \\n , edison , nj , usa ) . the supernatant was recovered in aseptic conditions , and dna was semipurified after precipitation with isopropanol at 20c ( hplc 99.5% , tecsiquim , sa de cv , mxico , df ) . \\n the pcr was performed in an mj research pt-200 equipment ( gmi , inc . , ramsey , mn , usa ) . the experimental conditions used were as follows : an initial denaturation phase at 94c for 10 minutes , then 30 cycles of 94c for 30 seconds , annealing at 49.7c for 30 seconds , and extension at 72c for 30 seconds , with a final primer extension at 72c for 10  min . \\n the pcr products were separated by electrophoresis through 1% agarose gels in 1x tae buffer ( 40  mm tris acetate , 1  mm edta ; invitrogen life technologies carlsbad , ca , usa ) run the gels for 40 minutes at 95 volts . \\n the gels were stained with 0.08 l / ml of ethidium bromide ( 10  mg / ml ; invitrogen life technologies carlsbad , ca , usa ) , and bands were visualized under uv light . \\n the biofilm production for se clinical isolates was assessed by congo red agar plates assay ( cra ) . this culture medium ( cra ) \\n , basingstoke , hampshire , england ) supplemented with congo red dye ; 0.8  g / l ( sigma - aldrich , co. , st . \\n louis , mo ) and sucrose ; 36  g / l ( j. t. baker , mxico ) . \\n all clinical se strains to be tested for biofilm formation were inoculated on cra plates . \\n these cra plates were incubated at 35c for 24  hrs then after the plates were maintained at room temperature for 24  hrs . \\n cra plates were checked for black colonies which represented the se biofilm producers or positive ( b+ ) , in contrast to the red colonies , which represented the se non - biofilm producers or negative ( b ) . \\n from 245 se clinical isolates , 34% ( 84 ) were detected as black colonies or biofilm - forming strains on cra plates . \\n the remaining se strains 66% ( 161 ) were grown as red colonies on these plates and therefore were considered as non - biofilm producers or negative strains ( figures 1(a ) and 1(b ) ) . \\n patterns of susceptibility / resistance to antibiotics of a total of 245 se strains were performed by automated micro scan system . \\n se clinical strains of biofilm producers were displayed lightly more resistant to 14 antimicrobial agents tested than se strains of non - biofilm producers ( table 1 ) . from 34% ( 84 ) \\n positive biofilm se strains , 91% ( 76 ) were confirmed as mrse by pcr meca gene . out of a total of 66% ( 161 ) \\n negative se isolates , 64% ( 103 ) strains were confirmed as mrse by pcr to meca gene ( table 2 ) . according to the infection sites \\n a total of 90 out of 245 ( 36% ) se strains were isolated from catheters 37 out of 90 ( 41% ) were assessed as biofilm producers the majority of these 36 ( 97% ) se strains were meca gene positive or confirmed as mrse . \\n a total of 71 se isolates were recovered from bloodstream infections ( bsi ) , 28% ( 20/71 ) were biofilm - forming strains , and 95% ( 19/20 ) were mrse . from 27 se strains isolated from urinary tract infections ( utis ) 33% ( 9/27 ) \\n were biofilm formers , and from these strains 67% ( 6/9 ) were confirmed as mrse . from the last group , including other infection sites , 57 se strains were isolated , and 32% ( 18/57 ) were biofilm producers and 83% ( 15/18 ) of these se strains were confirmed as mrse ( table 2 ) . \\n higher percentages of resistance to antibiotics and higher number of resistance markers were found in biofilm producer meca ( + ) clinical strains ( 9 to 14 ) than non - biofilm producer meca (  ) strains ( 3 to 8) ( figures 2 and 3 ) . \\n the percentage of antibiotic resistance in se biofilm producer strains is more relevant in the 40% of the meca gene positive strains mainly in those that present resistance to 13 resistant markers . in meca negative strains \\n are appreciated for strains with 6 resistance markers corresponding to 25% of strains ( figure 3 ) . \\n in the present study we observed a quite good correlation in antibiotic resistance and biofilm production for clinical mrse strains from patients with ni at this tertiary care hospital in mexico city . the majority of these clinical se strains were positive for molecular detection of the meca gene by pcr . \\n data from other hospitals in mexico , such as one report by diemond et al . , determined the presence of biofilm in se and cons strains for icaa operon by pcr method . in this study \\n se biofilm producer se strains were found in higher percentages in catheter sites . in our study 90 out of 245 strains were isolates from catheter site , and 37 out of 90 strains were positive for biofilm production . \\n caldern et al .   in a pediatric hospital of mexico city found resistance in 53.4% of cons strains to oxacillin . \\n , in a tertiary care hospital , made a surveillance study for the distribution of sccmec cassettes and its relationship to mrcons strains ; they found that se was the most common species identified and carrying the cassettes type iii , iva , and v for methicillin resistance . in a tertiary care hospital \\n group , describing the resistance to antibiotics in some isolates causing bacteremia during a six - year study period ( 19952000 ) , se was the third most frequently isolated bacteria and the oxacillin resistance pattern was increased from 41 % to 61% during this period [ 8 , 9 ] . \\n our research findings show that mrse strains carry a higher number of resistance determinants in biofilm - producer strains . \\n these strains were more frequently isolated in clinical samples from intravascular catheters in this tertiary care hospital . \\n profiles of resistance to 17 antibiotics tested were slightly higher in se strains of biofilm producers than in non - producer strains . \\n the phenotypic biofilm characterization by cra plates assay demonstrated a simple , rapid , cheap , and reliable approach for detection of biofilm producers in se isolates from patients with staphylococci ni . \\n it is highly recommended for the future a validation of this test versus genotypic test such as pcr detection for icaa and icad genes . \\n this molecular pcr methodology will be soon applied in this hospital for detection of other relevant antibiotic resistance markers , in order to establish a permanent ni - control program . \\n the pcr meca gene detection assay meets our requirements as a reliable molecular method for characterization of methicillin - resistant se strains . \\n both methods are urgently needed for molecular epidemiology studies and outbreak control in mexican hospitals . \\n finally our data suggest that this methodology could be used to establish infection control procedures for this tertiary care hospital in order to prevent nosocomial infections .\",\n          \"jarcho  levin syndrome is an eponym that represents a spectrum of short - trunk skeletal dysplasias with variable involvement of the vertebrae and ribs . \\n levin syndrome , including neural tube defects , arnold  chiari malformation , renal / urinary tract abnormalities , hydrocephalus , hydroureteronephrosis , and meningomyelocoele.[13 ] malformations of the spinal cord with a separation into two hemicords have been termed  diastematomyelia . \\n only four cases of jarcho  levin syndrome with diastematomyelia have been reported in the literature . \\n a one - and - half - year - old male child born of full - term normal delivery after a nonconsanguineous marriage was brought by his mother with complaints of progressively increasing weakness in lower limbs with inability to stand since 1 month . on examination , the child was found to be conscious , alert , and active . \\n the patient also had a congenital groove at the left costal margin which was not investigated at birth . \\n chest x0 -ray revealed irregular fusion of left sided ribs and scoliosis of thoracolumbar spine [ figure 1 ] . \\n magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography of the spine were done which revealed spina bifida defect at multiple levels in lumbosacral region . \\n there was evidence of diastematomyelia with a large intraspinal bony bar at l2l3 vertebral level . \\n the two hemicords were asymmetric ; left smaller than right and each hemicord was seen in a separate dural sac [ figures 2 and 3 ] . \\n a large bony spur was identified on the left side which was dividing the spinal canal into two parts . \\n the patient has been on follow - up since the last 3 years , but remains unable to walk without support . \\n chest x - ray showing irregular fusion of left sided ribs and scoliosis of thoracolumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging of the spine axial section showing evidence of diastematomyelia with a large intraspinal spur at l2l3 vertebral level . \\n the two hemicords were asymmetric ; left one smaller than right and each hemicord was seen in a separate dural sac computerized tomography of the spine showing diastematomyelia with a large intraspinal bony bar at l2l3 vertebral level \\n jarcho  levin syndrome ( jls ) , also known as spondylothoracic dysostosis ( std)/spondylocostal dysostosis ( scd ) , is a type of segmental costovertebral malformation . \\n classified cases of jls into two groups  spondylo costal dysostosis ( scd ) and spondylothoracic dysostosis ( std ) , based on the presence or absence of rib malformations . \\n individuals with scd had vertebral anomalies , intrinsic rib malformation ( broadening , bifurcation , abnormal orientation , and fusion ) , and flaring of iliac bones . cases with std had vertebral anomalies and a  fanlike  rib configuration but no intrinsic rib malformation . \\n mutations in the genes that are important components of the notch signaling pathway ( gene dll3 on chromosome 19 and mesp2 gene ) are responsible for the development of spondylocostal dysostosis ( costovertebral malformation ) in jarcho  levin syndrome . according to dias and walker , split cord malformations and related malformations occur as a result of embryological failure of midline axial integration during gastrulation . \\n levin syndrome is characterized by a short and rigid neck , short thorax , protuberant abdomen , and inguinal and umbilical hernias . \\n levin syndrome include congenital heart defects , abdominal wall malformations , genitourinary malformations , upper limb anomalies , neural tube defects and congenital diaphragmatic hernia . \\n radiologically , the  crab - like  appearance of the thoracic cage on ap projection is characteristic of std . \\n neural tube defects ( ntds ) like spina bifida , meningocele , meningomyelocoele , lipomyelomeningocele , and diastematomyelia have been reported to be associated with jarcho \\n levin syndrome cases.[279 ] spina bifida is present in 25% of patients with jarcho  levin syndrome . in 1991 , \\n karnes et al . suggested that individuals with vertebral and rib malformations with the absence of fan like chest configurations are more often short statured , have almost double the survival rate , are less likely to have neural tube defects ( spina bifida ) , and may inherit the disorder in autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant pattern . \\n individuals with a fanlike rib configuration and posterior tethering characteristic of std have a higher mortality rate and a higher incidence of neural tube defects , and inherit the disorder in an autosomal recessive manner . in cases of congenital segmental costovertebral malformations with neural tube defects , cases with type \\n malformations of the spinal cord with a separation into two hemicords have been termed  diastematomyelia . \\n the term  diplomyelia  is reserved as a true duplication of the spinal cord which is , however , difficult to demonstrate . in 1992 , pang et al . recommended the term  split cord malformation  for all double spinal cords . \\n a type i split cord malformation consists of two hemicords , each contained within its own dural tube and separated by a dura - sheathed rigid osseocartilaginous median septum . \\n a type ii split cord malformation consists of two hemicords housed in a single dural tube separated by a nonrigid , fibrous median septum . till date \\n four cases of diastematomyelia in patients with jarcho  levin syndrome have been reported . in 1976 , \\n elier jl and morton jm first reported a case in which diastematomyelia occurred in association with findings characteristic of the jarcho \\n levin syndrome in an infant born to a woman who abused lysergic acid diethylamide during pregnancy . \\n reyes et al . in 1989 reported a case of jarcho  levin syndrome associated with diastematomyelia ( type i split cord malformation ) and claimed that neurological abnormalities should be considered a component of the jarcho \\n giacoia gp and say b in 1991 described a patient with the jarcho  levin syndrome who also had spina bifida and diastematomyelia ( type i split cord malformation ) and suggested that this association is not coincidental and may be aetiologically related . \\n etus et al . in 2003 reported a case of jarcho  levin syndrome with diastematomyelia ( type i split cord malformation ) in a 7-year - old girl . \\n physicians and surgeons must be aware that spondylocostal dysplasia may be associated with diastematomyelia or other surgically correctable occult intraspinal anomalies which may be diagnosed in asymptomatic stage by magnetic resonance image screening of spine , because late diagnosis might have unsatisfactory outcome .\",\n          \"squamous cell carcinoma ( scc ) after ileal pouch -

related cancer [ 1 , 4 , 7 ] . \\n patients with these features are 8 times more likely of developing ipaa - related cancer , irrespective of mucosectomy . \\n seven [ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ] ipaa - related scc have been described , of which 5 developed from either the atz or rectal cuff [ 7 , 8 , 9 ] and 2 from the mucosa of the ileal pouch [ 10 , 11 ] ( table 1 ) . \\n dysplasia on the specimen is considered a risk factor for scc , but metaplasia of the ileal pouch could underlie scc , especially squamous metaplasia [ 10 , 11 ] . \\n this is poorly addressed in uc , whereas more attention is paid to the detection of dysplasia for subsequent cancer concern and surveillance . \\n crt is the treatment of choice for anal scc , but it can also achieve complete response in up to 66% of patients with rectal scc . it is largely agreed that pelvic irradiation is contraindicated in patients with a pelvic ileal pouch because of the predictable risk of radiation enteritis , which is likely to cause pouch failure due to structural damage to the mucosa and body of the reservoir . \\n however , no studies have addressed the actual role of radiotherapy in these patients , and these considerations might be even more interesting under the light of newer treatment regimens . \\n one paper reported crt   for an early tumour discovered on routine anal biopsy , and no description is provided concerning the stage [ 8 , 11 ] . \\n moreover , the patient suffered from poor function , with seepage and 20 bowel movements per day . when acute toxicity settled down , good function was restored , but the patient required diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate 8 times daily . \\n no data are available concerning the long - term effects of crt and treatment outcomes . \\n the largest series on the topic suggested that patients with rectal cancer can have ipaa , but radiotherapy before pouch surgery impairs subsequent function and increases failure rates . \\n european guidelines currently recommend that radiotherapy should precede pouch surgery and should be avoided after ipaa , even acknowledging that the evidence for that assumption is low . indeed , \\n scc located in the pouch body seem to be more aggressive and might be difficult to treat with radiation therapy . \\n out of 2 patients with scc occurring in the ileal pouch , 1 with scc close to the ileal pouch inlet was unsuitable for crt and died 6 months after pouch excision , and 1 was approached with pouch excision followed by crt ( mitomycin c , 5-fluorouracil , and local radiotherapy ) but had no response . \\n we were able to manage an scc of the ileal pouch by means of a crt protocol that achieved complete response , without the adverse effects of radiotherapy on pouch function . \\n avoiding excessive worsening of function is important , especially in frail patients , who may suffer from serious dehydration and electrolyte loss secondary to increased ileal pouch - anal output . \\n the early outcome was acceptable , and no particular measures were required apart from loperamide administration . in the long term , the patient did not need any surgical treatment , which is associated with a doubled risk of failure and dysfunction over time in ipaa [ 19 , 20 ] . \\n however , the decision on how to treat patients with scc and anal cancer of the pelvic pouch needs to be individualized , and patients and their relatives should participate in the decision - making process . \\n scheduled follow - up of the pouch is usually not recommended in uc patients without risk factors for cancer . \\n indeed , the risk of colorectal cancer arising from the rectal remnant or atz is lower after ipaa than the lifetime risk of cancer in the general population . \\n however , endoscopic follow - up and surveillance after ipaa probably need to be further elucidated [ 13 , 21 ] because scc may occur at some point even in patients with no known risk factor . \\n early detection is the key to preserve the pouch in patients who develop ipaa - related scc . \\n crt according to our regimen could be considered in scc arising from the rectal cuff or atz . \\n this could be the first - line approach in anal scc after ipaa , but it could also be advocated for other types of cancer , hopefully increasing the success rates and survival . \\n metaplasia of the pouch might play a role in scc , but this remains to be further elucidated . \\n patients with pelvic pouches receiving crt should be followed up with scheduled long - term appointments including pouchoscopy to diagnose recurrence and late adverse effects of radiation . \\n written informed consent for patient information and images to be published was provided by the patient . \\n  \\n \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10540,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"staphylococcus epidermidis strains isolated from nosocomial infections represent a serious problem worldwide . in various mexican states several reports have shown isolates from hospitals with antibiotic resistance to methicillin . in mexico city , there is scarce information on staphylococcal infections in hospitals . here \\n , our research findings are shown in a four -

sided glomus jugulare tumor , a benign paraganglioma . \\n a 43-year - old right - handed woman with history of glomus jugulare tumor in the left jugular fossa with intracranial extension into the posterior cranial fossa was transferred from another hospital for recurrent seizure - like spells . \\n she had a 90% surgical resection of the tumor done in 2011 followed by radiation therapy in september 2012 . \\n her episodes occurred multiple times a day ( 7 per day on average ) during wakeful state . \\n they were triggered by coughing ( usually a bout of cough ) and were characterized by staring and unresponsiveness as well as stiffening of the body with mild shaking of both upper extremities . \\n she was diagnosed with epileptic seizures but continued to have episodes during treatment with the antiepileptic drugs ( aeds ) phenytoin , levetiracetam , and lamotrigine . \\n escalation of aed therapy made her increasingly drowsy , and she was on all three aforementioned aeds at the time of presentation . \\n her physical examination was remarkable for excessive drowsiness , mild dysarthria , right sixth cranial nerve palsy , mild hypertonia with hyperreflexia in the lower extremities ( left more than right ) , and bilateral ( left more than right ) ankle clonus . \\n she had a lumbar puncture done at the outside hospital , and the opening cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) pressure was reported to be 25  cm . \\n blood work was also unremarkable except for mild anemia ( hemoglobin : 9.4  g / dl ) , mild hyponatremia ( 132  meq / l ) , and mild hypokalemia ( 3.1  meq / l ) . \\n antiepileptic drug levels were within therapeutic range ( free phenytoin : 1.3  g / ml , levetiracetam : 5.9  g / ml , and lamotrigine : 2.3  g / ml ) . \\n all started with a bout of cough when the patient was lying in bed ( in supine or in lateral position ) which was followed by brief ( less than a minute ) distal upper extremity tremor and subtle proximal upper extremity myoclonic jerks and prolonged unresponsiveness for up to 10  min . \\n all of these episodes were associated with hypotension ( 7278/3147  mm of hg as revealed by continuous arterial pressure monitoring ) and bradycardia ( 5459  bpm ) . \\n the eeg during the spells was characterized by generalized synchronous and asynchronous high amplitude 1- to 2-hz delta activity which progressed to generalized attenuation and then transitioned to generalized delta activity again with recovery ( fig .  1 ) . \\n a head ct showed recurrence of the glomus jugulare tumor and communicating hydrocephalus . an external ventricular drain ( evd ) \\n after placement of the evd , her drowsiness gradually started to improve , and episodes decreased in frequency to one per day . \\n 3 showed an enhancing t2 hyperintense left skull base mass in the region of the left jugular foramen with extension into the posterior cranial fossa and below the base of the skull . \\n brain imaging showed evidence of hydrocephalus that had increased compared with her previous brain imaging done 2  months back . \\n her mental status continued to improve , and she had only one mild episode triggered by cough during the next two days before her discharge . \\n repeat surgical resection of the tumor was recommended by the otolaryngology team , which the patient declined . \\n based on the clinical features and eeg findings , the episodes observed in our patient are most consistent with cough syncope . \\n the mechanism underlying cough syncope is not definitively established , but it is postulated that coughing increases intrathoracic and intraabdominal pressures leading to a transient increase in icp . increased icp , in turn , causes a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure which , if it drops below a critical level , may result in global cerebral hypoperfusion leading to syncope . \\n transient cerebral circulatory arrest has been demonstrated by transcranial doppler measurements during cough syncope . our patient also had a drop in blood pressure and heart rate but probably not sufficient to cause syncope by itself . \\n cough syncope has been associated with posterior fossa mass lesions or tonsillar herniation and with hydrocephalus . \\n it may be speculated that bouts of cough caused transient herniation of cerebellar tonsils obstructing csf flow that further contributed to the increase in icp during coughing . \\n decrease in frequency of events following placement of evd to relieve icp lends support to this notion . \\n paragangliomas are rare tumors of extraadrenal chromaffin cell origin that most commonly occur in the head and neck region . \\n catecholamine - hypersecreting paraganglionomas are uncommon in the head and neck region , and most patients ( 95% ) with hypersecreting paraganglionomas have hypertension . \\n hypotension accompanying syncope observed in our patient was not orthostasis - related ( the patient was always supine during spells ) and was most likely related to cough . \\n identified a subset of patients with cough syncope who lacked a blood pressure overshoot ( expected response ) after the relief of straining during valsalva maneuver . \\n the authors postulate that cough syncope in these patients might be the result of delayed recovery from hypotension that follows a paroxysm of cough , and this was likely contributing to global cerebral hypoperfusion in our patient . \\n this case highlights the fact that cough syncope , a rare form of syncope , may be associated with intracranial mass lesions that indirectly exaggerate the increase in icp in response to cough . \\n glomus caroticum tumor presenting as recurrent unexplained syncope   and posterior fossa meningioma presenting as recurrent cough syncope   have been described . \\n recurrent cough syncope should trigger search for factors , including brain tumors , with the potential to cause transient elevation in icp . \\n this case also illustrates an important role for ceeg monitoring with video in distinguishing syncope from seizures in cough syncope cases . \\n \",\n          \"diabetes decreases the overall life expectancy and cause a heavy burden on public health ( 1 ) . \\n moreover , the asia - pacific region is considered to be on the verge of an emerging diabetes epidemic ( 2 ) . \\n the development of type 2 diabetes is affected by genetic and environmental determinants ( 3 ) . \\n recently , one study investigated whether common variants of functional and positional candidate genes , including adrb3 , pparg , enpp1 and capn10 , were determinants of type 2 diabetes ( 4 ) . \\n enpp1 , also called k121q , has a glutamine substitution for lysine at codon 121 ( 5 ) . \\n type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance ( 6 ) , and enpp1 plays an important role in insulin resistance ( 7 , 8) . \\n enpp1 interacts with -subunit of the insulin receptor to interrupt signaling ( 9 ) . in previous studies , the k121q polymorphism of the human pc-1 gene was strongly associated with insulin resistance ( 1 , 3 , 7 , 10 - 12 ) . however , there was no association between insulin resistance and the k121q variant ( 13 , 14 ) . \\n in addition , there were discrepancies for the impact of enpp1 polymorphism on obesity between ethnic groups ( 5 , 10 , 13 , 15 - 19 ) . \\n obesity increases the concentration of insulin in plasma and is the major contributor of insulin resistance ( 20 ) . \\n obesity appears to be an effect modifier of type 2 diabetes in d1057 carriers ( 21 ) . \\n the association of obesity with the genetic variant of the insulin receptor substrate was identified in other studies ( 21 , 22 ) . in the chinese han population , \\n the pc-1 q121 allele was associated with insulin resistance . in women , carriers of the q allele \\n had an increased risk for obesity development ( 3 ) . in caucasians and african - americans , 121q carriers had an association with increased body mass index ( bmi ) ( 23 ) , and the three - allele risk type haploid qdeltg with the q allele increased the risk for obesity ( 24 ) \\n however , in the danish population , there were no differences in the distribution of frequencies of dominant types ( kk wild type and kq / qq variant type ) and alleles ( 19 ) . \\n the complexity of type 2 diabetes is related to factors such as genetic heterogeneity , interactions between genes , and the modulating role played by the environment ( 4 ) . in spite of these limitations , studies of type 2 diabetes and genetic factors of obesity \\n can predict the risks for development of both type 2 diabetes and obesity in order to assist primary prevention , and korea is an appropriate country for such studies because of the homogeneity of racial composition and lifestyle ( 25 ) . \\n therefore , the aim of this study was to analyze the presence of the enpp1 polymorphism , not studied yet in korean population , to identify the association between genotypes and allele with type 2 diabetes and obesity . \\n this company is an electric power company located at kori , yonggwang , ulchin , wolsung , and seoul in korea . \\n there were 195 male workers ( age 48.26.7 yr , bmi 24.672.64 kg / m ) who were diagnosed as diabetics during medical examinations conducted from march 2004 to october . \\n the 1,750 male workers ( age 45.27.7 yr , bmi 24.772.64 kg / m ) in the control group were selected randomly . \\n subjects were included if they met one of the criteria below and their onset age was older than 20 yr old to exclude type 1 diabetes : 1 ) blood -

weinberg equilibrium was computed based on the  goodness - of - fit test . \\n we also investigated the differences in frequencies of genotypes between type 2 diabetic and normal groups , and between obesity and normal groups by fisher 's exact test . \\n the spss 12.0 ( for window ) statistical software package was used for statistical analysis . \\n the frequencies of the kk type , kq type , and qq type in enpp1 k121q were 82.1% , 17% and 0.9% , respectively . \\n the homozygous type of q carrier ( qq type ) was added to the heterozygous type ( kq type ) because the frequency of qq type was very low ( 0.9% ) . \\n we investigated the differences in age , blood pressure , bmi , and results of clinical examinations according to genotypes of enpp1 k121q between the type 2 diabetic and non - diabetic groups ( table 1 ) . when type 2 diabetics and non - diabetics were pooled ( n=1,945 ) , there were no significant differences in bmi , systolic pressure , diastolic pressure , glucose value in fasting status , total cholesterol , ldl cholesterol , hdl cholesterol , triglyceride , c - reactive protein , and homa - ir between the kk type and kq+qq type . \\n in addition , there were no significant differences in the same characteristics above between type 2 diabetic group and non - diabetic groups ( table1 ) , and between the obese group and non - obese groups ( table2 ) . \\n the frequencies of genotypes were in accordance with the hardy - weinberg equilibrium ( p=0.85 ) . \\n the odds ratio of having a kq+qq genotype was 0.85 for diabetics versus non - diabetics . \\n the odds ratio of having a q allele was 0.91 for diabetics versus non - diabetics . \\n however , there was no significant difference in the genotypic and allelic distribution between type 2 diabetics and non - diabetics ( table3 ) . \\n the odds of a kq+qq genotype were 0.93 for obese versus non - obese subjects . furthermore , the odds of having a q allele were 0.96 for obese versus non - obese subjects \\n . however , there was no significant difference in the genotypic and allelic distribution between obese and non - obese ( table4 ) . \\n the frequency of the kk type in enpp1 k121q genotypes was 82.1% , that of kq+qq type was 17.9% and that of q allele was 9.4% . \\n there was no statistically significant difference in the distribution among these genotypes and alleles ( p=0.81 , p=0.89 , respectively ) , although the 121q carrier and q allele in obese and/or diabetics seemed to differ slightly from those in the non - obese non - diabetics ( reference group ) . in determining the prevalence of the q allele carriers ( kq and qq subjects ) and q allele \\n , there were no significant differences in the genotypic and allelic distribution with the respect to any phenotypes ( data not shown ) . \\n after adjusting for the effects of obesity , the probability of type 2 diabetes in kq+qq type was 0.858 ( data not shown ) and that in q allele was 1.095 , showing no significant difference ( table 5 ) . \\n moreover , after adjusting for the effects of type 2 diabetes , the probability of developing obesity in the kq+qq type was 0.936 ( data not shown ) and that in the q allele was 1.038 , showing no significant difference ( table 6 ) . \\n the results of studies of the association between enpp1 k121q variants and both type 2 diabetes and obesity in several races are disparate . \\n we carried out this study to investigate the association of k121q variants with type 2 diabetes and obesity in korean male workers . \\n insulin resistance is a major component of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes ( 27 ) , and insulin receptor kinase activity is impaired in muscle and other insulin - sensitive tissue of many type 2 diabetic patients ( 28 ) , and then a potential inhibitor of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase is identified as the plasma - cell membrane differentiation antigen-1 ( pc-1 ) ( 29 ) . \\n therefore , it is significant to analyze enpp1 ( pc-1 ) polymorphism . in the previous studies of the association between type 2 diabetes and polymorphism in enpp1 , the k121q missense mutation increased the odds ratio ( or ) for type 2 diabetes in dominican ( 10 ) , south asian , caucasian ( 16 ) , finnish ( 18 ) , and french populations ( 24 ) . \\n moreover , according to a meta - analysis of the association between enpp1 k121q variant and type 2 diabetes , the odds ratios were 1.30 ( 95% confidence interval [ ci ] , 1.13 - 1.50 ) ( 16 ) and 1.17 ( 95% ci , 1.10 - 1.25 ) ( 19 ) , showing significant association . in this study , 121q was not associated with type 2 diabetes , showing consistent results with those in the japanese population ( 5 ) , danish caucasians ( 13 ) , oji - cree population ( 17 ) , finnish population ( 18 ) , and danish white subjects ( 19 ) . \\n most type 2 diabetes in koreans is characterized by non - obesity , thus the enpp1 k121q mutant relevant to insulin resistance possibly could be a candidate gene that is not appropriate to explain susceptibility to type 2 diabetes . \\n this can be a possible explanation for the lack of association between enpp1 121q carrier and type 2 diabetes in this study . \\n obesity is a main risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes ( 20 ) and there is linear association between obesity and type 2 diabetes ( 3 ) . in previous studies of the association between obesity and polymorphism in enpp1 , \\n 121q carriers and/or q allele were associated with obesity in the chinese han population ( bmi of obesity group 27 kg / m ) ( 3 ) , caucasians ( bmi of obesity group > 90th percentile ) , african - american adults ( bmi of obesity group > 80th percentile ) ( 23 ) , french population ( bmi of obesity group 95th percentile ) ( 24 ) , and dominican population ( bmi of obesity group 30 kg / m ) ( 10 ) . however , in this study ( bmi of obesity group 25 kg / m ) , there was no difference in distribution between obesity and 121q carriers and presence of the q allele . \\n this result was consistent with those from a study of 7,333 danes ( 19 ) and a spanish population ( 14 ) in which the bmi of the obesity group was 25 kg / m or higher . on the other hand , in matsuoka 's study , \\n the percentage of subjects whose bmi was 30 kg / m or higher was too low ( 2.5% ) to investigate the effect of k121q genotype on obesity . \\n the results of the present study showed that the frequencies of the q allele was 8.7% in the type 2 diabetic group and 9.2% in the obesity group , which was lower than those in finnish and swedish populations ( 12.9 - 15.1% ) ( 11 ) , danish caucasians ( 14 - 16% ) ( 13 ) , south asians in chennai ( 14% ) , caucasians in dallas ( 16% ) , south asians in dallas ( 19% ) ( 16 ) , the dominican population ( 54.2% ) ( 10 ) and , black children ( 77% ) ( 30 ) . \\n the frequencies of the q allele investigated in this study might have a smaller statistical power to explain any association with either type 2 diabetes or obesity with 121q carriers ( kq+qq ) and/or the q allele . in conclusion \\n , the present study suggests that the enpp1 k121q polymorphism was not associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity . \\n the results of negative associations in this study might be attributable to the low prevalence of obesity , relatively younger age , and low frequencies of the 121q carriers . \\n large and prospective studies are needed to confirm this preliminary observation in the korean population .\",\n          \"world - wide , infertility affects 1015% of couples who are trying to conceive , and about 15% of these cases are caused by male factors , which affect 1 out of 20 men in the general population . \\n most cases of male infertility are idiopathic , apart from several etiologies , such as obstruction of deferent duct , varicocele , sexual dysfunction , and cryptorchidism . \\n although assisted reproductive technology ( art ) has helped many sterile couples to conceive , non - obstructive azoospermia ( noa ) , which accounts for a considerable proportion of male infertility , has a dramatically lower rate of sperm retrieval and clinical pregnancy . \\n the etiological mechanism of noa is unknown , but factors such as oxidative stress were considered to have effects on spermatogenesis , and some antioxidants have been effective in protecting spermatogenesis . \\n therefore , it is helpful to explore the underlying pathogenesis of noa in these patients . micrornas are a class of small rnas that do not code amino acid sequences , but they play fundamental roles in regulating gene expression after transcription . \\n lian et al . found 154 down - regulated mirnas and 19 up - regulated mirnas in testes of noa patients compared to fertile males , by using microarray technologies . \\n furthermore , some of the mirnas have been shown to affect the proliferation , apoptosis , and dna damage in germ cells [ 911 ] . \\n mir-210 is one of the 19 up - regulated mirnas in testes of noa patients , located within the genomic loci of transcript ak123483 . \\n it can be induced by hypoxia , and plays an essential role in cell adaptation to hypoxia . \\n mir-210 also affects regulation of diverse physiological processes , such as angiogenesis , cell survival , proliferation , cell cycle arrest , protein modification , and dna damage repair . \\n although mir-210 has been shown to be involved in regulation of physiological processes in various diseases and to be an up - regulated mirna in testes of noa patients , it remains unknown how mir-210 affects spermatogenesis . \\n hence , the aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanisms by which mir-210 is involved in the pathogenesis of spermatogenesis . \\n we enrolled 25 patients ( aged 1841 years ) with azoospermia ( proven by 3 semen analyses from testicular biopsies from the first affiliated hospital of anhui medical university ) . \\n pathological examinations were performed on each testicular specimen . combined with clinical features , 4 patients were diagnosed as having sertoli -

igf2 ( abcam ) was used for western blot analysis , and we used -actin as a loading control to detect expression of igf2 . \\n we supplemented the medium with 10% fetal bovine serum ( life technology inc . ) , 1% antibiotics ( 100 units / ml penicillin , and 100 ug / ml streptomycin , life technology inc . ) . \\n cells were incubated at 37c in a humidified incubator with 5% co2 . to transfect oligonucleotides and plasmids into nt-2 cells , lipofectamine rnaimax ( invitrogen ) and fugene hd ( roche ) \\n  \\n the igf2 gene is part of a cluster of imprinted genes expressing the single polypeptide as igf2 , which is only produced from the paternal allele . \\n the maternal allele is transcriptionally silent . to clarify the location of igf2 in human testicular tissues , \\n we found igf2 located in spermatocytes in the testes of patients with oa ( figure 1 ) . because igf2 is located in spermatocytes of the testis , we detected the expression of igf2 in cases with ma , hypospermatogenesis , and oa , but not in the scos patients . \\n we found that igf2 was down - regulated in patients with ma and hypospermatogenesis compared to oa patients , which was considered as the control group with normal spermatogenesis , although without a significant difference ( figures 2 , 3 ) , possibly because there were fewer samples and longer preservation times of some samples . \\n quantitative real - time pcr was performed to examined mir-210 expression in the testis of patients with ma , hypospermatogenesis , and oa . we found that mir-210 was significantly up - regulated in the testis of ma and hypospermatogenesis patients compared to oa patients ( figure 4 ) . however , due to errors in the rna extraction in the preliminary experiment , 3 testis samples ( 1 each ) from ma , hypospermatogenesis , and oa patients were damaged and were not tested . in the targetscan database , because the 3utr of the igf2-mrna has a putative mir-210-binding site , igf2 was predicted to be a potential target of mir-210 . to identify whether the igf2 gene was targeted by mir-210 directly , renilla luciferase reporters , which include the wild - type full - length 3utr forms of mir-210 seeding sites , \\n figure 5 shows that there was a 60% decrease in luciferase activity after cotransfection of the mir-210 mimic and the renilla luciferase reporters into nt2 cells , and inhibiting mir-210 expression increased activity of the reporter renilla luciferase . \\n expression of igf2 protein was also significantly lower in the nt2 cells transfected with mir-210 mimics than in control cells , and knockdown of mir-210 with mir-210 inhibitor increased protein expression of igf2 ( figures 6 ) . \\n the igf2 gene is part of a cluster of imprinted genes expressing the single polypeptide as igf2 , which is only produced from the paternal allele . \\n the maternal allele is transcriptionally silent . to clarify the location of igf2 in human testicular tissues , \\n we found igf2 located in spermatocytes in the testes of patients with oa ( figure 1 ) . \\n because igf2 is located in spermatocytes of the testis , we detected the expression of igf2 in cases with ma , hypospermatogenesis , and oa , but not in the scos patients . \\n we found that igf2 was down -

regulated mirnas in testes of patients with noa , was involved in spermatogenesis in male infertility . \\n the transformation of diploid spermatogonia into mature haploid cells in spermatogenesis is a complex biological process in the testes of males . \\n the insulin / igf system takes part in the processes of cell proliferation , cell growth , differentiation , and survival , which affects nearly every organ in the body . \\n also , insulin / igf plays an important role in the proper function of the testis in males . \\n igf2 binds to igf1r and insr - a with a high affinity and binds to insr - a / igf1r , insr - b / igf1r , but with lower affinity . \\n found that in inactivated insr and igf1r , there was a 79% reduction in daily sperm production in adult mouse testes by a conditional ko approach . taken together , the aforementioned data suggest that igf2 might be involved in the process of spermatogenesis . to examine the specific mechanism by which mir-210 is associated with the process of spermatogenesis , quantitative real - time pcr was performed to detect mir-210 expression . \\n we found that mir-210 was significantly up - regulated in the testes of subjects with ma and hypospermatogenesis patients compared to oa . \\n these results agree with findings of lian et al . using microarray technologies performed in noa and normal controls . \\n several studies have suggested that this mirna could be mediated by hypoxia and participate in various types of regulation of angiogenesis , cell survival , proliferation , cell cycle arrest , and protein modification [ 1214 ] . \\n furthermore , some researchers even found that mir-210 might be considered as one of the indicated markers in some diseases , such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia . in the present study we found that igf2 was targeted by mir-210 directly in the in vitro experiment in nt2 cells , and mir-210 might be associated with spermatogenesis by targeting igf2 in male infertility . \\n firstly , as some errors occurred in the rna extraction in the preliminary experiment , mir-210 of 3 testes samples were damaged and not detected in the subsequent quantitative real - time pcr experiment , which might have affected our results . \\n secondly , we did not investigate the functions of mir-210 and igf2 in vitro or in vivo , and we plan to do this in future research . \\n we demonstrated that mir-210 might be associated with spermatogenesis by targeting igf2 in male infertility . \\n future mechanistic studies on the role of mir-210/igf2 in the process of spermatogenesis in male infertility will provide new insights into the diagnosis and management of male infertility .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"we present an unusual case of recurrent cough syncope in a 43-year -
