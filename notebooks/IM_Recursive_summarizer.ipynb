depression [ 13 ] . \\n although anxiety and depression are often related and coexist in pd patients , recent research suggests that anxiety rather than depression is the most prominent and prevalent mood disorder in pd [ 5 , 6 ] . yet , \\n our current understanding of anxiety and its impact on cognition in pd , as well as its neural basis and best treatment practices , remains meager and lags far behind that of depression . \\n overall , neuropsychiatric symptoms in pd have been shown to be negatively associated with cognitive performance . \\n for example , higher depression scores have been correlated with lower scores on the mini - mental state exam ( mmse ) [ 8 , 9 ] as well as tests of memory and executive functions ( e.g. , attention ) [ 1014 ] . \\n likewise , apathy and anhedonia in pd patients have been associated with executive dysfunction [ 10 , 1523 ] . \\n however , few studies have specifically investigated the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd . \\n one study showed a strong negative relationship between anxiety ( both state and trait ) and overall cognitive performance ( measured by the total of the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status index ) within a sample of 27 pd patients . \\n furthermore , trait anxiety was negatively associated with each of the cognitive domains assessed by the rbans ( i.e. , immediate memory , visuospatial construction , language , attention , and delayed memory ) . \\n two further studies have examined whether anxiety differentially affects cognition in patients with left - sided dominant pd ( lpd ) versus right - sided dominant pd ( rpd ) ; however , their findings were inconsistent . \\n the first study found that working memory performance was worse in lpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd patients with anxiety , whereas the second study reported that , in lpd , apathy but not anxiety was associated with performance on nonverbally mediated executive functions and visuospatial tasks ( e.g. , tmt - b , wms - iii spatial span ) , while in rpd , anxiety but not apathy significantly correlated with performance on verbally mediated tasks ( e.g. , clock reading test and boston naming test ) . \\n furthermore , anxiety was significantly correlated with neuropsychological measures of attention and executive and visuospatial functions . taken together , \\n it is evident that there are limited and inconsistent findings describing the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd and more specifically how anxiety might influence particular domains of cognition such as attention and memory and executive functioning . \\n it is also striking that , to date , no study has examined the influence of anxiety on cognition in pd by directly comparing groups of pd patients with and without anxiety while excluding depression . \\n given that research on healthy young adults suggests that anxiety reduces processing capacity and impairs processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory [ 26 , 27 ] , we hypothesized that pd patients with anxiety would show impairments in attentional set - shifting and working memory compared to pd patients without anxiety . \\n furthermore , since previous work , albeit limited , has focused on the influence of symptom laterality on anxiety and cognition , we also explored this relationship . \\n seventeen pd patients with anxiety and thirty - three pd patients without anxiety were included in this study ( see table 1 ) . \\n the cross - sectional data from these participants was taken from a patient database that has been compiled over the past 8 years ( since 2008 ) at the parkinson 's disease research clinic at the brain and mind centre , university of sydney . \\n inclusion criteria involved a diagnosis of idiopathic pd according to the united kingdom parkinson 's disease society brain bank criteria   and were confirmed by a neurologist ( sjgl ) . \\n patients also had to have an adequate proficiency in english and have completed a full neuropsychological assessment . \\n ten patients in this study ( 5 pd with anxiety ; 5 pd without anxiety ) were taking psychotropic drugs ( i.e. , benzodiazepine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) . \\n patients were also excluded if they had other neurological disorders , psychiatric disorders other than affective disorders ( such as anxiety ) , or if they reported a score greater than six on the depression subscale of the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) . \\n thus , all participants who scored within a  depressed  ( hads - d > 6 ) range were excluded from this study , in attempt to examine a refined sample of pd patients with and without anxiety in order to determine the independent effect of anxiety on cognition . \\n this research was approved by the human research ethics committee of the university of sydney , and written informed consent was obtained from all participants . \\n self - reported hads was used to assess anxiety in pd and has been previously shown to be a useful measure of clinical anxiety in pd . \\n a cut - off score of > 8 on the anxiety subscale of the hads ( hads - a ) was used to identify pd cases with anxiety ( pda+ ) , while a cut - off score of < 6 on the hads - a was used to identify pd cases without anxiety ( pda ) . \\n this criterion was more stringent than usual ( > 7 cut - off score ) , in effort to create distinct patient groups . \\n the neurological evaluation rated participants according to hoehn and yahr ( h&y ) stages   and assessed their motor symptoms using part iii of the revised mds task force unified parkinson 's disease rating scale ( updrs ) . in a similar way \\n this was determined by calculating a total left and right score from rigidity items 3035 , voluntary movement items 3643 , and tremor items 5057 from the mds - updrs part iii ( see table 1 ) . \\n processing speed was assessed using the trail making test , part a ( tmt - a , z - score ) . \\n attentional set - shifting was measured using the trail making test , part b ( tmt - b , z - score ) . \\n working memory was assessed using the digit span forward and backward subtest of the wechsler memory scale - iii ( raw scores ) . \\n language was assessed with semantic and phonemic verbal fluency via the controlled oral word associated test ( cowat animals and letters , z - score ) . \\n the ability to retain learned verbal memory was assessed using the logical memory subtest from the wechsler memory scale - iii ( lm - i z - score , lm - ii z - score , % lm retention z - score ) . the mini - mental state examination ( mmse ) \\n demographic , clinical , and neuropsychological variables were compared between the two groups with the independent t - test or mann  whitney u test , depending on whether the variable met parametric assumptions . \\n chi - square tests were used to examine gender and symptom laterality differences between groups . \\n all analyses employed an alpha level of p < 0.05 and were two - tailed . \\n spearman correlations were performed separately in each group to examine associations between anxiety and/or depression ratings and cognitive functions . \\n as expected , the pda+ group reported significant greater levels of anxiety on the hads - a ( u = 0 , p < 0.001 ) and higher total score on the hads ( u = 1 , p < 0.001 ) compared to the pda group ( table 1 ) . \\n groups were matched in age ( t(48 ) = 1.31 , p = 0.20 ) , disease duration ( u = 259 , p = 0.66 ) , updrs - iii score ( u = 250.5 , p = 0.65 ) , h&y ( u = 245 , p = 0.43 ) , ledd ( u = 159.5 , p = 0.80 ) , and depression ( hads - d ) ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.06 ) . \\n additionally , all groups were matched in the distribution of gender (  = 0.098 , p = 0.75 ) and side - affected (  = 0.765 , p = 0.38 ) . \\n there were no group differences for tmt - a performance ( u = 256 , p = 0.62 ) ( table 2 ) ; however , the pda+ group had worse performance on the trail making test part b ( t(46 ) = 2.03 , p = 0.048 ) compared to the pda group ( figure 1 ) . \\n the pda+ group also demonstrated significantly worse performance on the digit span forward subtest ( t(48 ) = 2.22 , p = 0.031 ) and backward subtest ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.016 ) compared to the pda group ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) . \\n neither semantic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.70 , p = 0.49 ) nor phonemic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.39 , p = 0.70 ) differed between groups . \\n logical memory i immediate recall test ( u = 176 , p = 0.059 ) showed a trend that the pda+ group had worse new verbal learning and immediate recall abilities than the pda group . however , logical memory ii test performance ( u = 219 , p = 0.204 ) and logical memory % retention ( u = 242.5 , p = 0.434 ) did not differ between groups . \\n there were also no differences between groups in global cognition ( mmse ) ( u = 222.5 , p = 0.23 ) . \\n participants were split into lpd and rpd , and then further group differences were examined between pda+ and pda. importantly , the groups remained matched in age , disease duration , updrs - iii , dde , h&y stage , and depression but remained significantly different on self - reported anxiety . \\n lpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span forward test ( t(19 ) = 2.29 , p = 0.033 ) compared to lpda , whereas rpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span backward test ( u = 36.5 , p = 0.006 ) , lm - i immediate recall ( u = 37.5 , p = 0.008 ) , and lm - ii ( u = 45.0 , p = 0.021 ) but not lm % retention ( u = 75.5 , p = 0.39 ) compared to rpda. \\n this study is the first to directly compare cognition between pd patients with and without anxiety . \\n the findings confirmed our hypothesis that anxiety negatively influences attentional set - shifting and working memory in pd . \\n more specifically , we found that pd patients with anxiety were more impaired on the trail making test part b which assessed attentional set - shifting , on both digit span tests which assessed working memory and attention , and to a lesser extent on the logical memory test which assessed memory and new verbal learning compared to pd patients without anxiety . taken together , \\n these findings suggest that anxiety in pd may reduce processing capacity and impair processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory in a similar way as seen in young healthy adults [ 26 , 27 ] . \\n although the neurobiology of anxiety in pd remains unknown , many researchers have postulated that anxiety disorders are related to neurochemical changes that occur during the early , premotor stages of pd - related degeneration [ 37 , 38 ] such as nigrostriatal dopamine depletion , as well as cell loss within serotonergic and noradrenergic brainstem nuclei ( i.e. , raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus , resp . , which provide massive inputs to corticolimbic regions ) . over time \\n , chronic dysregulation of adrenocortical and catecholamine functions can lead to hippocampal damage as well as dysfunctional prefrontal neural circuitries [ 39 , 40 ] , which play a key role in memory and attention . \\n recent functional neuroimaging work has suggested that enhanced hippocampal activation during executive functioning and working memory tasks may represent compensatory processes for impaired frontostriatal functions in pd patients compared to controls . therefore , chronic stress from anxiety , \\n for example , may disrupt compensatory processes in pd patients and explain the cognitive impairments specifically in working memory and attention seen in pd patients with anxiety . \\n it has also been suggested that hyperactivation within the putamen may reflect a compensatory striatal mechanism to maintain normal working memory performance in pd patients ; however , losing this compensatory activation has been shown to contribute to poor working memory performance . \\n anxiety in mild pd has been linked to reduced putamen dopamine uptake which becomes more extensive as the disease progresses . \\n this further supports the notion that anxiety may disrupt compensatory striatal mechanisms as well , providing another possible explanation for the cognitive impairments observed in pd patients with anxiety in this study . \\n noradrenergic and serotonergic systems should also be considered when trying to explain the mechanisms by which anxiety may influence cognition in pd . although these neurotransmitter systems are relatively understudied in pd cognition , treating the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems has shown beneficial effects on cognition in pd . \\n selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , citalopram , was shown to improve response inhibition deficits in pd , while noradrenaline reuptake blocker , atomoxetine , has been recently reported to have promising effects on cognition in pd [ 45 , 46 ] . \\n overall , very few neuroimaging studies have been conducted in pd in order to understand the neural correlates of pd anxiety and its underlying neural pathology . \\n future research should focus on relating anatomical changes and neurochemical changes to neural activation in order to gain a clearer understanding on how these pathologies affect anxiety in pd . to further understand how anxiety and cognitive dysfunction are related , \\n future research should focus on using advanced structural and function imaging techniques to explain both cognitive and neural breakdowns that are associated with anxiety in pd patients . \\n research has indicated that those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who have more neuropsychiatric symptoms have a greater risk of developing dementia compared to those with fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms . \\n future studies should also examine whether treating neuropsychiatric symptoms might impact the progression of cognitive decline and improve cognitive impairments in pd patients . \\n previous studies have used pd symptom laterality as a window to infer asymmetrical dysfunction of neural circuits . \\n for example , lpd patients have greater inferred right hemisphere pathology , whereas rpd patients have greater inferred left hemisphere pathology . \\n thus , cognitive domains predominantly subserved by the left hemisphere ( e.g. , verbally mediated tasks of executive function and verbal memory ) might be hypothesized to be more affected in rpd than lpd ; however , this remains controversial . \\n it has also been suggested that since anxiety is a common feature of left hemisphere involvement [ 48 , 49 ] , cognitive domains subserved by the left hemisphere may also be more strongly related to anxiety . \\n results from this study showed selective verbal memory deficits in rpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd without anxiety , whereas lpd patients with anxiety had greater attentional / working memory deficits compared to lpd without anxiety . \\n although these results align with previous research , interpretations of these findings should be made with caution due to the small sample size in the lpd comparison specifically . \\n recent work has suggested that the hads questionnaire may underestimate the burden of anxiety related symptomology and therefore be a less sensitive measure of anxiety in pd [ 30 , 50 ] . in addition , our small sample size also limited the statistical power for detecting significant findings . \\n based on these limitations , our findings are likely conservative and underrepresent the true impact anxiety has on cognition in pd . additionally , the current study employed a very brief neuropsychological assessment including one or two tests for each cognitive domain . \\n future studies are encouraged to collect a more complex and comprehensive battery from a larger sample of pd participants in order to better understand the role anxiety plays on cognition in pd . \\n another limitation of this study was the absence of diagnostic interviews to characterize participants ' psychiatric symptoms and specify the type of anxiety disorders included in this study . \\n future studies should perform diagnostic interviews with participants ( e.g. , using dsm - v criteria ) rather than relying on self - reported measures to group participants , in order to better understand whether the type of anxiety disorder ( e.g. , social anxiety , phobias , panic disorders , and generalized anxiety ) influences cognitive performance differently in pd . \\n one advantage the hads questionnaire provided over other anxiety scales was that it assessed both anxiety and depression simultaneously and allowed us to control for coexisting depression . \\n although there was a trend that the pda+ group self - reported higher levels of depression than the pda group , all participants included in the study scored < 6 on the depression subscale of the hads . \\n controlling for depression while assessing anxiety has been identified as a key shortcoming in the majority of recent work . \\n considering many previous studies have investigated the influence of depression on cognition in pd without accounting for the presence of anxiety and the inconsistent findings reported to date , we recommend that future research should try to disentangle the influence of anxiety versus depression on cognitive impairments in pd . considering the growing number of clinical trials for treating depression , there are few if any for the treatment of anxiety in pd . \\n anxiety is a key contributor to decreased quality of life in pd and greatly requires better treatment options . \\n moreover , anxiety has been suggested to play a key role in freezing of gait ( fog ) , which is also related to attentional set - shifting [ 52 , 53 ] . \\n future research should examine the link between anxiety , set - shifting , and fog , in order to determine whether treating anxiety might be a potential therapy for improving fog .\", 'small non - coding rnas are transcribed into mrna but remain untranslated in eukaryotic cells . \\n they include sirna ( small interfering rna ) , mirna ( microrna ) , pirna ( piwi - interacting rna ) and snorna ( small nucleolar rna ) . \\n mirnas are a class of multifunctional singled - stranded small rna which are ~20  nt in length and regulate the stability or translational efficiency of targeted messenger rna depending on the base - pairing complementarity between the mirna and its target mrna [ 1 , 2 ] . although over 1,000 mirna sequences have been identified from the tissues or cells of human origin and other species , as many as 1,000 to 10,000 mirnas per genome have been predicted [ 3 , 4 ] . \\n mirnas regulate a broad range of biological processes including timing of development , cell cycle progression , stem cell self - renewal , differentiation , cancer initiation , cancer cell proliferation , metastasis and apoptosis [ 511 ] . \\n cancer is caused by multiple processes including uncontrolled cellular proliferation and inappropriate survival of apoptotic cells . \\n many regulatory factors switch on or off genes that govern cell division and direct cellular proliferation . \\n mirnas regulate gene expression and play important roles in the onset and progression of tumorigenesis . \\n emerging evidence demonstrates the involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis , functioning either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes . \\n although the current treatment of radiation therapy , chemotherapy and hormone therapy slow mammary gland tumor growth , prolong survival and improve the quality of patients life , metastatic breast cancer still remains incurable due to our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which tumorigenesis and metastasis occur . \\n as small non - coding rnas regulate gene expression and tumorigenesis , they may represent a novel cancer therapy . \\n unlike mrna , mirnas are transcribed but never translated . some mirnas are transcribed from non - coding regions between genes , deriving from independent transcription unit . \\n other mirnas are transcribed together with coding mrnas from the coding region of the genome , deriving from the introns of gene transcripts [ 13 , 14 ] . \\n mirna gene copy number gain / loss and mirna gene mutation have been observed in breast cancer resulting in the aberrant expression of mirna . \\n the first study about the altered expression of mirnas in human breast cancer patients and human breast cancer cell lines was reported in 2005 by lorio et al . , \\n in which 29 mirnas were identified with aberrant expression based on microarray and northern blot analysis of 76 breast tumor samples and 14 human breast cell lines . \\n zhang and colleagues analyzed 283 human mirna genes on 55 human breast primary tumors and 18 human breast cancer cell lines using array - based comparative genomic hybridization . \\n the results demonstrated a high frequency ( ~72.8% ) of gene copy number abnormality in mirna - containing regions in human breast cancer . \\n wang et al . collected 68 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and examined the expression of selected mirnas in tumor and adjacent non - tumor tissues . \\n mir-21 , mir-106a and mir-155 were significantly over - expressed in the tumor specimens compared with normal controls , whereas mir-126 , mir-199a and mir-335 were significantly decreased in expression in the tumor samples . \\n our studies of the mir-17 - 92 cluster demonstrated decreased expression of mir-17/20 in human breast cancer specimens compared with matching normal breast tissue from the same patient . \\n subsequent analysis identified reduced mir-17/20 expression in node - positive compared with node - negative breast cancers and demonstrated that mir-17/20 inhibited breast cancer cell migration and invasion via a heterotypic signaling . \\n although the tendency for a global decrease of mirna expression in human cancers originally suggested a general tumor suppressor function of mirnas , subsequent studies showing the aberrant expression of specific mirnas in breast cancer suggest mirna - specific roles in breast cancer onset and progression . \\n many distinct mirnas have been shown to regulate breast cancer cell proliferation , apoptosis , cancer stem cell expansion , and tumorigenesis . \\n mirna may function as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes depending on the cell type , culture conditions , target genes and pathway . \\n the involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis has been reviewed recently [ 21 , 22 ] . \\n le et al . described the expression pattern and regulatory network of key mirnas in breast cancer , including let-7 , mir-34 , mir-125 , mir-200 family , mir-205 , mir-21 , mir-10 and the mir-17 - 92 cluster . \\n adams et al . reviewed the mirna regulation of estrogen signaling pathway and erbb2/her signaling pathway in breast cancer . \\n the understanding of how mirnas are involved in breast cancer through regulating the cell cycle remains rudimentary . \\n herein we summarize the recent literature and research progress on the mechanism by which mirnas regulate the breast cancer cell cycle and cellular proliferation ( fig . \\n 1mirna regulation of mammary gland tumorigenesis in control of the cell cycle . through targeting different genes and different cyclin / cdk complexes , mir-17/20 and \\n let-7 regulate the g1-s transition ; mir-21 and mir-27a regulate the g2-m checkpoint mirna regulation of mammary gland tumorigenesis in control of the cell cycle . through targeting different genes and different cyclin / cdk complexes , mir-17/20 and \\n let-7 regulate the g1-s transition ; mir-21 and mir-27a regulate the g2-m checkpoint cyclin d1 is either overexpressed or amplified in ~50% of breast cancer . \\n the abundance of cyclin d1 is rate - limiting in breast cancer cellular proliferation and g1-s phase transition [ 23 , 24 ] . \\n in addition , cyclin d1 is a critical downstream target of erbb2- , ras- and -catenin- induced breast cancers , and is sufficient for the induction of mammary tumors when targeted to the mammary gland of mice . \\n antisense inhibition of cyclin d1 expression in vivo suppressed the growth of neut - transformed mammary adenocarcinoma cells in nude mice . \\n conserved sequences of the cyclin d1 3utr contain potential binding sites for multiple mirnas including mir-17/20/106 , mir-15/16 , mir-23 and let-7 . \\n mir-17/20 binds the cyclin d1 3utr , inhibiting the expression of cyclin d1 , resulting in cell cycle arrest at the g1 phase and suppression of mcf-7 cell proliferation [ 18 , 26 ] . \\n the regulation of cyclin d1 expression by mir-17 - 92 , as well as mir-15/16 , was confirmed by deshpande et al . . \\n the let-7 family functions as a tumor suppressor in a variety of cancers including lung , colon , ovarian   and breast cancer . \\n schultz et al . demonstrated the downregulation of cyclin d1 by mirna let-7 in control of cancer cell growth . \\n the regulation of cyclin d1 by mirna is likely of broad importance as cyclin d1 encodes the regulatory subunit of a kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates the prb family proteins to inhibit dna synthesis , and phosphorylates nuclear respiratory factor 1 ( nrf-1 ) to inhibit mitochondria biogenesis [ 32 , 33 ] . \\n furthermore , cyclin d1 promotes breast epithelial cell angiogenesis and migration , and promotes chromosomal instability which in turn contributes to tumorigenesis . \\n the mir-221/222 cluster regulates the cell cycle , cell growth and epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) in breast cancer . \\n mir-221/222 inhibited p27 and p57 abundance , facilitating g1-s phase transition , thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation [ 36 , 37 ] . \\n moreover , mir-221/222 may contribute to the aggressive clinical behavior of basal - like breast cancers . \\n the breast cancer basal - like subtype - specific mirnas , mir-221 and mir-222 , promote emt in breast cancer by targeting trps1 ( trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 1 ) which inhibits emt by repressing zeb2 expression . \\n mir-221 and/or mir-222 expression in mcf-7 and t47d breast cancer cells decreased er expression associated with tamoxifen resistance . \\n the onco - mirna mir-21 is overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers including breast cancer [ 40 , 41 ] . \\n mir-21 induced cellular proliferation , migration , invasion , emt , cancer stem cell characteristics and chemotherapy resistance in human breast cancer [ 42 , 43 ] . \\n high mir-21 level is associated with poor prognosis , advanced stage , positive lymph node status and reduced survival time in breast cancer . \\n mir-21 promotes mcf-7 cellular proliferation in part through inhibiting the expression of a tumor suppressor gene programmed cell death 4 ( pdcd4 ) . in colon cancer , \\n mir-21 participates in a dna damage - induced g2-m checkpoint through suppressing the cell cycle regulator cdc25a . \\n a recent report demonstrated the mir-21 regulates the cell cycle through targeting cdc25a in mcf-7 breast cancer cells . with a potential anti - cancer chemical 3,3-diindolylmethane treatment , \\n mir-27a expression is upregulated in human breast cancer cell lines . in mda - mb-231 cells , \\n mir-27a negatively regulated the zinc finger zbtb10 gene and myt-1 , thereby promoting breast cancer cell proliferation . \\n mir-27a suppressed myt-1 , increased cdc2/cyclin b activity and promoted the g2-m checkpoint in mda - mb-231 cells . thus , distinct mirnas affect key genetic targets that govern distinct cell - cycle checkpoints including cyclins , cdks , cdk inhibitors and the g2-m regulation apparatus . \\n in addition to cell - cycle control , breast tumor onset and progression and breast tumor stem cells are also regulated by distinct mirnas . \\n cancer stem cells ( cscs ) are characterized by their self - renewal capacity , an ability to differentiate into non - tumorigenic cell progeny , and their ability to seed tumors when transplanted into animal hosts . \\n cell surface markers such as cd44 , cd24 , cd133 , epithelial - specific antigen and aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 are frequently used to isolate and enrich cscs . \\n the involvement of mirnas in regulating tumor formation by cscs or tumor - initiating cells ( t - ic ) has been widely investigated . \\n let-7 expression is very low to undetectable level in embryonic stem cells ( es cells ) and increases with differentiation . \\n a comparison of mirna expression between breast t - ic and non - t - ic demonstrated reduced let-7 expression in t - ic and increased abundance with differentiation . \\n transduction of breast cscs with let-7 reduced the proportion of undifferentiated cells , inhibited cell proliferation , mammosphere formation , and tumor formation in vivo . \\n clarke and colleagues identified 37 mirnas which were differentially expressed between human breast cscs ( cd44cd24lineage ) and lineage nontumorigenic breast cancer cells . \\n the mir-200 family members were downregulated in human breast cscs and normal mammary stem / progenitor cells . \\n expression of mir-200 inhibited breast cancer stem cell expansion in vitro , and suppressed the tumor formation ability of human breast cancer stem cell in vivo . \\n ectopic mir-34c expression reduced breast t - ics self - renewal , inhibited emt and suppressed tumor cell invasiveness via silencing notch4 . \\n zhu et al . found the reduced mir-128 expression in human breast t - ic was accompanied by bmi-1 and abcc5 overexpression , and associated with chemotherapeutic resistance and poor survival . \\n enforced mir-128 expression increased the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to doxorubicin - induced apoptosis and dna damage . \\n emerging evidence has demonstrated the importance of cscs in cancer initiation , cancer metastasis and drug resistance . \\n cscs are believed to be one of the most promising targets for cure of cancer . \\n the discovery that non - coding rnas regulate cscs widens our understanding of cscs , and may provide potential novel strategies for breast cancer therapy . \\n deletion of chromosome 6q , including region 6q14-q16 , is frequently observed in breast cancer . \\n the small non - coding snorna u50 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene in the 6q14 - 16 region , playing a role in the development and/or progression of breast cancer . \\n genomic deletion and transcriptional downregulation of snorna u50 was detected in breast cancer cell lines . \\n re - expression of snorna u50 inhibited colony formation of the human breast cancer cells hs578 t and mda - mb-231 . \\n pirnas are small non - coding rna that form rna - protein complexes through interactions with piwi proteins . \\n pirna was initially discovered in germ line cells , and considered as germ line - specific small rnas . \\n emerging evidence indicates that pirna expression occurs in somatic cells [ 57 , 58 ] and piwil2 expression has been identified in human breast cancer cells . \\n high - throughput deep sequencing identified a group of small rnas matching pirna sequences in human breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines . \\n the study of these non - coding small rnas in human cancer is just starting . \\n the identification of the expression signature of these non - coding small rnas in breast cancer subtypes , and an understanding of their functional significance to oncogene expression , tumor initiation and tumor cell metastasis may shed important new perspectives on the role of these non - coding small rnas in breast cancer . \\n small non - coding rna - based diagnostic and therapeutic applications for human cancer are expected in the near future . although tumor - targeted delivery and local administration are still major challenges to the practical application of gene therapy for cancer , mirna - based cancer therapeutic approaches are being established and tested in animal models . \\n synthetic mirna mimics or mirna expression vectors have been successfully applied to restore or overexpress mirna in vitro . chemically modified lna anti - sense mirna inhibitor and other approaches have been used to block mirna function in cells . \\n kim et al . recently reported significant anti - tumor effect of virus - mediated delivery of mir-145 combined with 5-fu to treat breast cancer . \\n intranasal delivery of let-7   and intravenous delivery of mir-34a mimics   for non - small - cell lung cancer treatment and a virus - mediated delivery of mir-26a for liver cancer treatment in mouse model   demonstrate the promise of mirna for treatment of cancer . \\n dysregulated expression of mirnas has implicated components of the non - coding genome as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors of breast cancer . \\n experimental evidence has shown specific mirnas regulating the initiation , progression , metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancer via control of the cell cycle , altering cellular proliferation , altering cellular apoptosis and/or controlling the population of tumor stem cells . dysregulated \\n mirna expression has also been observed in cancer associated fibroblasts ( caf ) and in the systemic circulation [ 65 , 66 ] . \\n the circulating mirnas have the potential to serve as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer . \\n a specific subset of dysregulated mirnas in breast cancer cells may serve as targets for gene therapy either alone or as an adjuvant treatment to current clinical protocols for breast cancer patients .', 'congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( cah ) refers to a group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by an enzyme deficiency which leads to defects in biosynthesis of steroid precursors . \\n depending on the severity and degree of 21 hydroxylase deficiency , the clinical spectrum may vary from mild form of non classical cah to classic cah . \\n however , the non classical cah variant is more common with a prevalence rate of 1 in 1000 . \\n it also helps in maintaining normal levels of precursors by suppressing adreno cortico trophic hormone ( acth ) . during childhood \\n , the management is largely focused on achieving normal growth and attaining appropriate final adult height . \\n johns medical college hospital , bangalore by the department of endocrinology on patients diagnosed to have cah and seen in the outpatient clinic between january 2012 and october 2012 . during this period \\n data regarding demography , clinical presentation at time of diagnosis , treatment details , height sds and bmi were collected . \\n all patients underwent biochemical testing for 17 hydroxy progesterone ( 17 ohp ) levels for assessment of adequacy of therapy . bone age assessment with left hand and wrist \\n bmi was calculated for all patients and obesity was defined using who charts as values above 95th percentile . \\n 17 ohp levels between 1 ng / ml and 12 ng / ml were considered appropriate ; values below 1 ng / ml suggested suppression and over treatment and values above 12 ng / ml suggested under treatment . \\n 29 patients were included in the study of which 22 were females ( 76% ) and 7 were males ( 24% ) . based on the cross sectional data collected , 11 patients were adults ( age > 18 ) and 18 patients were children ( 62% ) . among the males , \\n one child was identified at birth via a neonatal screening program , one child presented with early pubarche , the other 5 infants presented between their 3rd and 6th week of life with features suggestive of adrenal crisis - poor feeding , vomiting and failure to gain weight . \\n one of the male patients incidentally also had a penoscrotal hypospadias which was surgically corrected . among the females , \\n 9 infants were identified at birth due to presence of genital ambiguity ( 40% ) , 1 presented with symptoms of adrenal crisis at 4 weeks of life , 4 patients presented in the pre pubertal period due to early onset adrenarche ( 18% ) , 5 patients presented in the late adolescent period with marked virilization ( 23% ) and 3 patients presented with features of poly cystic ovarian disease ( pcos ) . \\n all the five patients who presented in the late adolescent period had obvious genital ambiguity from birth , however , they sought medical attention only much later due to marked virilization and failure to attain menarche . \\n one among them had actually been evaluated and even underwent a clitoroplasty at a young age , but unfortunately , the diagnosis of cah was missed as she was mistakenly categorized as probable ovo testicular dsd due to presence of mullerian structures with a phallic length of around 6 cm . \\n all these 5 women had a masculine built at presentation with poor breast development , severe hirsutism , muscular body habitus , temporal balding and varying degrees of deepening of voice . \\n the non classical cah ( nccah ) patients presented in adulthood with complaints of irregular cycles and hirsutism ; they had no features of virilisation . \\n simple virilizing was the most common sub class seen among the women ( 81% ) whereas the salt wasting type was predominant among boys ( 85% ) . \\n around 35% of patients had short stature as defined by height sds < -2.0 ; 2 patients who presented with adrenarche had increase in height sds , however , their bone age was also correspondingly advanced . \\n all the children were treated with hydrocortisone ; almost all adult patients were on dexamethasone . \\n none of the nccah patients were treated with glucocorticoids ; they were on anti - androgen therapy along with oral contraceptive pills . \\n most adult classic cah patients with complaints of hirsutism were treated with either spironolactone or finasteride . \\n pubertal induction with ethinyl estradiol was initiated for three of the adult patients who sought medical care late . \\n analysis of 17 ohp levels revealed that 32% were suppressed with levels less than 1ng / ml ; appropriate in 47% and inadequate in 21% of patients . \\n we report the phenotypic features of a cohort of patients with cah being evaluated and managed in a tertiary centre in southern india . in this series , \\n the typical presentation of male babies were with adrenal crisis between the 3 and 6 week of life . around 20% of female patients with classic cah \\n were identified and appropriately treated only after late adolescence even when genital ambiguity was present since birth . \\n short stature was seen in one third of patients on therapy and the average final adult height among patients with classic cah was 142.37 , which was significantly lower than the mean adult height for females in our population . \\n the mean final adult height of 157.5 cm for those with nccah was better than their classic cah counterpart . \\n obesity and hypertension were not found to be significantly higher in this cohort of cah patients . \\n one third of patients had suppressed 17 ohp levels suggestive of over replacement therapy which may also contribute to the reduction in the final adult stature .', 'the family is the cornerstone of human social support network and its presence is essential in everyone s life . changes inevitably occur in families with illness and hospitalization of a family member . in other words , among the sources of stress for families are accidents leading to hospitalization particularly intensive care unit ( icu ) . \\n statistics show that 8% of hospital beds in the united states are occupied by the intensive care units . \\n stress in the family while the patient is in the icu can disrupt the harmony power of the family members and finally , it may causes disturbances in the support of the patient . \\n in addition to the various sources of stress in intensive care units such as the patient s fear of death , financial problems , lack of awareness about the environment and etc . , their satisfaction level is another important source of stress for the patient s family . \\n today , the family needs of hospitalized patients in the icu are summarized in five sections . \\n these factors may include receiving assurance , staying close to the patient , receiving information , feeling comfortable and receiving support . \\n however , in many cases , the patient s family needs and their expectations in the icu will not be fulfilled which will cause dissatisfaction . since , how families deal with mental stress is the most important components of comprehensive care , it should be known that attention to the family needs of the patients hospitalized in intensive care units could increase their satisfaction and thus a reduction in stress disorders . \\n studies showed that the nurses in particular sections focus primarily on the patient and the disease . \\n therefore , attention to the families should be considered as an important part in patient management . \\n effective interventions targeted at the needs and expectations of family members should help to reduce the stress and improve their satisfaction . \\n fox et al . stated that the needs of the family members were not often overlooked by the nurses . \\n however , the nurses spend a lot of time with the patients and their families and are in a good position to assess their needs and plan for meeting these needs with appropriate interventions . \\n the reason of investigating the satisfaction of the families of the patients in the icu is that the patients are facing life - threatening illness experiences and complex treatments , different technologies and different equipment are used for them . \\n these cases could potentially lead to the dissatisfaction of their families . in the meantime , \\n the families of trauma and neurosurgical patients are more vulnerable than the other groups of patients . \\n they need supports that are more emotional and should be accepted by the icu staff . today , there are many theories expressed that in intensive care units , the patient and his family should be considered as a single unit . by providing care to this unit , \\n the aim of this study was to analyze the satisfaction of the families of icu patients . \\n the tool of society of critical care medicine s family needs assessment ( sccmfna ) ( which has been validated in 1998 by johnson ) was used in that study . \\n the results showed that most of the family satisfaction was related to the communication and patient care and the lowest level of satisfaction was about the ability of staff to patients family comfort . \\n bailey et al . have conducted a study in 2009 with the purpose of investigating the relationship between informational support to families of special care patients and their anxiety and satisfaction . \\n they showed that there is a direct link between the informational support and their satisfaction . \\n the study of fumis et al . in 2008 also showed that the increase in the availability of physicians for giving the information to the patient s family and as well as nurses efforts to provide understandable explanations about the patient s condition to them will increase the patient s family satisfaction . \\n this clinical trial was performed with respect to the existing gap for a study carried out for investigating the interventions for the satisfaction of the patients in the special care units and their families in iran . \\n the purpose of the study was to determine the effectiveness of nursing interventions based on family needs on family satisfaction level of hospitalized patients in the neurosurgery intensive care unit of al - zahra hospital in 2010 . \\n the statistical research community was the families of hospitalized patients in neurosurgery intensive care unit of al - zahra ( sa ) hospital , isfahan , iran from may to september 2010 . \\n with respect to inclusion criteria , the families of 64 patients were selected with simple sampling . after obtaining the informed consents from the hospitalized patients , by using the envelopes , which were prepaid by using a table of random numbers , they were divided into two groups ( intervention and control ) . \\n the inclusion criteria was included as the following cases : to be a first - degree member of the family , to be older than 18 years , willing to participate in the study , having the power to speak and write in farsi , to be hospitalized one day before the study , lack of physical or mental problem in the family member , no responsibility for the care of another patient , introduced as the first person responsible for the patient care . \\n obtaining the written informed consent , completion of the questionnaires about demographic information and the families satisfaction were performed in the second day of hospitalization of the patients in icu in both groups . \\n johnson questionnaire for the satisfaction of the family of icu patients was used to measure the family satisfaction . \\n the rating of the questionnaire was performed by using the likert scale with four options of 0 to 4 as follows : almost all the time ( 3 scores ) , often ( 2 scores ) , only occasionally ( 1 score ) and never ( zero score ) . \\n johnson s questionnaire was the modified type of multer patient s family needs , which was evaluated in various scientific researches and there are extensive evidences for its validity . \\n the interventions were performed in the second and the third day of hospitalization of the patient in the neurosurgery icu by the researcher in the morning shift for the intervention group . \\n thus , the researcher provided understandable explanations about the disease to the patient s family and answered honestly to the questions about the patient and the disease . \\n the researcher ensured them for providing the best care in the section and spoke about the prognosis of the disease . \\n the researcher took the family member to the patient s room and gave the necessary information about the room space , equipment , personnel departments and the actions that were done for the patient . \\n the patient family member was contacted if there was a change in the patient condition . \\n they let the family help the patient in some cases of the public health ( such as hand and foot massage and giving food ) . \\n locations of rest , nutrition , prayer room , bathroom and buffet of the hospital were introduced to them . \\n the telephone numbers of hospitals and wards ( and if necessary , the social worker and supervisor ) were given . \\n various departments and personnel of the hospital were taught to accept the families and communicate with them . the hospital social worker was introduced and if necessary , the patient s family was allowed to express their feelings . \\n these interventions were performed in the evening shift of the second and the third day of the patient reception . \\n the actions were carried out by the fellow researcher . while , for the control group , only the routine work was done . on the fourth day , the satisfaction survey was completed by the selected family member in both of the intervention and control groups . \\n statistical methods used in this study were 2 test , man - whitney , independent student s t - test and paired t - tests . \\n the findings did not show statistically significant difference in the demographic characteristics of the intervention and control groups , such as : age ( p < 0.99 ) , gender ( p < 0.79 ) , marital status ( p < 0.41 ) , educational level ( p < 0.12 ) and relation with patient ( p < 0.54 ) . as shown in table 1 \\n , there was no significant difference in the mean satisfaction score before the intervention in the intervention and control groups ( p > 0.05 ) . \\n the mean satisfaction score after the intervention in the intervention group was significantly more than the control group ( p < 0.001 ) . \\n the mean satisfaction score in the intervention group after the intervention was significantly higher than before the intervention ( p < 0.001 ) . \\n there was no significant difference in the mean satisfaction score in the control group before and after the intervention ( p > 0.05 ) ( table 2 ) . \\n comparison of mean satisfaction score ( 100 * ) of participants in the intervention and control groups the mean of satisfaction score changes of the studied subjects in the intervention and control groups after intervention \\n the results of the present study showed that the nursing interventions based on the family needs increased the patient s family satisfaction in the neurosurgery intensive care unit of al - zahra hospital . \\n due to the differences in the study design , study population , the number of samples and methods of intervention , it would be difficult to compare the results . in chien et al . \\n study , the results showed that performing the training based on the patients family needs in the icu , decreased the anxiety and increased their satisfaction . in the study of myhren et al . indicated that effective communication of the staff with the families of icu patients would increase their satisfaction . \\n in the study by rosher and robinson , it showed that involving the families in patient care led to increase their satisfaction than before the intervention . \\n the mentioned results were consistent with the results of this study , because all of these interventions were some parts of the interventions performed in this study . \\n however , the study of steele et al . indicated that clinical training had no impact on the family satisfaction of the patient hospitalized in the icu \\n . therefore , there was no statistically significant difference in the satisfaction level in the control and intervention group . \\n in this study , it was shown that the use of nursing interventions based on family needs ( confidence , support , information , proximity and convenience ) had significant impact on the family satisfaction of the patient hospitalized in intensive care unit . \\n they should be based on the family investigation and recognition and their priority needs should be determined in order to cause the greatest satisfaction . \\n the icu nurses must also accept their role in the care of patient s family members . \\n the findings of this study could be a basis for performing further studies about family needs of the patients in the icu especially with the different forms of culture and economy . \\n consequently , the increase in family satisfaction of patients can reduce the stress disorders and improve their mental state and ultimately better support of the patient by the family . \\n this study only examined the effect of nursing interventions in the first days of hospitalization on the satisfaction of the families but the effects on the patient s entire hospitalization period has not been assessed . by performing other researches in this field \\n , it would be possible to compare the differences in the effects of nursing interventions based on the needs of families in the early days and the whole period of the patient s hospitalization .', \"development of human societies and industrialization as well as changes in stress sources has changed disease pattern in civilized societies . as a result , the disease pattern has changed from traditional diseases such as infectious diseases and malnutrition to diseases such as heart disease , diabetes , accidents and so forth . among them \\n coronary artery disease is the most cardiovascular disorder as a health problem in developing and developed countries . \\n in fact , this is not only a chronic disease associated with high mortality , but it causes limitations in life and disability in a large part of the productive forces of the country . \\n it is also associated with reduced production and increased medical costs [ 3 - 5 ] . nowadays , \\n cardiovascular diseases are among the most widespread chronic diseases in most countries . according to forecasts , \\n the mortality rate in eastern mediterranean countries including iran will be 30 - 35% [ 6 , 7 ] . despite the emphasis on prevention and development of newtreatments , surgery is the only choice for many patients with cardiovascular disease . \\n one of the surgical procedures for the treatment of cardiovascular patients is coronary artery bypass surgery . \\n in fact , heart surgery significantly influences on the quality of life of patients with cardiovascular diseases . \\n hence , heart surgery is an important event in the lives of patients causing collapse of economic , professional and personal life . on the other hand , each surgical procedure \\n is associated with several psychological complications for patients . of the most important complications are anxiety and depression so that approximately 65% of cardiovascular patients experience them after surgical and medical interventions . \\n in fact , anxiety and depression complicate the treatment process [ 7 , 8 ] . \\n some scientists believe that anxiety is one of the essential elements of human life . however , acute and long - term anxiety is integral part of all psychological diseases . according to nemati and colleagues , \\n in fact , anxiety is a common psychological response of cardiovascular patients which is associated with reduced quality of life and psychological morbidity [ 11 , 12 ] . on the other hand , \\n anxiety causes increased heart rate and breathing as well as high blood pressure and even mortality . \\n it is associated with increased risk of mortality , disability , increased medical care and functional impairment in daily activities [ 12 , 13 ] . clinical depression has been reported in 54% of patients after bypass surgery . according to world health organization ( who ) , depression is the fourth chronic disease where its disability is comparable with 8 major chronic disorders . \\n the outcome of depression in patients with cardiovascular disease is deterioration of physical and emotional state . given the incidence of such complications in patients with cardiovascular disease \\n the best practice in this area is appropriate communication with patient [ 13 , 15 ] . \\n good and effective communication is very valuable from the perspective of patients . in general , communication is a set of learning skills . \\n in fact , poor communication is the cause of most problems in treatment of patients . \\n in fact , communication at the bedside is a therapeutic and professional communication . in health professionals , \\n communication and communication skills play a very important role in satisfaction of patients and solving their problems . \\n this is more important , especially in patients with chronic diseases or those requiring long - term care . \\n the therapeutic communication is formed from the first encounter of the patient with the medical team [ 21 , 22 ] . \\n however , studies have shown that the communication between patient and medical team is not efficient . \\n the health personnel don not have adequate communication skills . in fact , nursing and medical team spend very little time to communicate with patients . \\n accordingly , patients are not often satisfied with received information as well as the level and method of communication . \\n hence , to achieve best therapeutic results , special attention should be paid to communication [ 16 , 19 , 22 ] . \\n since nursing is a practical discipline based on professional knowledge , it is necessary to use knowledge infrastructure to develop new approaches in clinical practice . \\n theories proposed by nursing scientists can be useful in this area [ 16 , 19 , 23 ] . for this purpose \\n the nurse - patient communication is an essential element of this theory [ 21 , 24 ] . according to peplau theory , \\n the purpose of nursing care is to achieve a common good nurse - patient communication . according to peplau , \\n peplau refers to the importance of therapeutic communication with patients and its important role in reducing anxiety [ 21 , 23 , 24 ] . \\n in fact , this theory provides a framework for nurse - patient communication . following this framework \\n , the nurse will be able to respond communication needs of patients through establishing a good therapeutic communication with the patient [ 16 , 19 , 23 ] . \\n hospitalization and a complex surgery such as heart surgery is a stressful process leading to depression in patients . \\n furthermore , the need for security and psychological comfort is one of the basic needs of patients achieved through a proper structured therapeutic communication with low cost . \\n accordingly , the objective of the present study is to examine the impact of peplau therapeutic communication model on anxiety and depression in patients who were candidate for coronary bypass surgery . \\n this is a clinical trial with pre / post testing scheme examined the impact of independent variable ( peplau therapeutic communication ) on the dependent variables ( anxiety and depression ) . \\n the population consisted of all patients who were candidates for coronary artery bypass referred to the research environment on non - emergency basis . \\n the research environment was al - zahra heart hospital in shiraz due to the easy access to subjects and sufficient number of patients . \\n data were collected using the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( kanter et al . ) . \\n the reliability and validity of the scale have been studied by montazeri et al in 2003 . \\n an internal consistency of 78% and 86% was respectively calculated for anxiety and depression using cronbach 's alpha . \\n there are 14 four - option questions , each with a score of zero to 3 . \\n odd and even questions are used to measure anxiety and depression , respectively ( seven questions to assess anxiety and seven questions to assess depression ) . \\n a score of zero to 21 is given to each patient based on responses in each area ( a score of zero - seven : normal , eight-10 : moderate and > 10 : disease ) . \\n due to the lack of access to error rate to calculate the sample size , 10 patients were selected as pilot ( with a depression and anxiety score of 10 or more based on the hospital anxiety and depression scale ) . after performing tests , \\n the subjects were randomly divided into test and control groups ( using a coin ( toss ) ) . \\n z12+z12s12+s22x1x22 the inclusion criteria were : being in a bypass list , having moderate to severe depression and anxiety scores , no history of mental illness , interesting in participating in the study ( i.e. the tendency of the patient and his family to participate in the intervention ) , lack of previous bypass surgery , aged between 35 and 70 years , ability to communicate verbally and ability to speak persian . \\n the exclusion criteria included : lack of cooperation of patients and families during the intervention , failure to perform coronary artery bypass surgery for various reasons , mortality during the study , failure to attend therapeutic communication sessions ( at least the absence in two sessions ) . \\n therapeutic communication sessions were held for the intervention group based on peplau 's model at four stages including : orientation , identification , exploitation and resolution . in total , seven sessions were held individually with the consent of the patient and his family at the hospital and patient 's home \\n . it should be notedthat during therapeutic communication , duration of each session was variable given the location and patient 's needs . \\n the place of each meeting was determined with the consent of the patient . at all meetings , the researcher used verbal and nonverbal communication skills to communicate with patients . to ensure the correct application of therapeutic communication skills , a self - control researcher - made tool approved by experts was used . \\n the depression and anxiety of patients in both groups were assessed using the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) at baseline and then two and four months after surgery . \\n the obtained data were analyzed using descriptive statistics as well as covariance analysis with the help of spss 16 . \\n this study was approved by the ethics committee of the jondi shapoor medical university of ahvaz with rec.1392.58 code . \\n the ethical issues considered in this study include an adequate explanation for the patients and their permission to participate in the study , the lack of any compulsion for patients to participate in the study , refusing to disclose secrets or private matters of patients and confidentiality of information , announcing the results without names and personal details . \\n furthermore , the present study was registered with the irct2013072214110n1 code in clinical trial center ( irct.ir ) . \\n this study was approved by the ethics committee of the jondi shapoor medical university of ahvaz with rec.1392.58 code . \\n the ethical issues considered in this study include an adequate explanation for the patients and their permission to participate in the study , the lack of any compulsion for patients to participate in the study , refusing to disclose secrets or private matters of patients and confidentiality of information , announcing the results without names and personal details . \\n furthermore , the present study was registered with the irct2013072214110n1 code in clinical trial center ( irct.ir ) . \\n the percentage of male and female patients in the intervention group was 70.3% and 29.7% , respectively . \\n the percentage of males and females in the control group was 51.4% and 48.6% , respectively . \\n the status of the underlying disease was depicted in both intervention and control groups . according to results \\n , the majority of patients were suffering from high blood pressure in both groups with a high frequency of 35.1% ( table 1 ) . \\n as shown in table 2 , anxiety was reduced in the intervention group , while postoperative anxiety in the control group was increased . the hospital anxiety in the intervention group \\n this indicates the role of peplau 's therapeutic communication in reducing hospital anxiety of patients . \\n analysis of covariance was used to determine the effect of peplau 's therapeutic communication on anxiety level of the subjects . since \\n hospital anxiety scale was used to measure anxiety , analysis of variance was performed using hospital anxiety scores . \\n the results showed significant differences between experimental and control groups in terms of anxiety level immediately after surgery , two and four months after surgery after adjustment for post - test scores by eliminating the effect of pre - test . \\n adjusted mean anxiety scores suggest that anxiety in the intervention group was lower than the control group . \\n in fact , the mean anxiety scores of patients in the intervention group in pre - test and post - test stages represent the independent role of peplau 's therapeutic communication model in reducing anxiety in the intervention group ( f=174.02 , p=0.000 ) . \\n moreover , the anxiety level in the intervention group two and four months after the intervention was decreased compared to the control group ( f=38.37 , p=0.000 ; f=11.58 , p=0.000 ) ( table 3 ) . as shown in table 4 , the mean depression in the intervention group was reduced after the surgery . the mean postoperative depression in the control group was increased . \\n in fact , the hospital depression in the intervention group was reduced after the therapeutic communication . \\n this indicates that the role of peplau 's therapeutic communication model in reducing hospital depression . \\n analysis of covariance was used to determine the effect of peplau 's therapeutic communication on depression level of the subjects . since \\n hospital depression scale was used to measure depression , analysis of variance was performed using hospital depression scores . \\n the results showed significant differences between experimental and control groups in terms of depression level immediately after surgery , two and four months after surgery after adjustment for post - test scores by eliminating the effect of pre - test . \\n adjusted mean depression scores suggest that anxiety in the intervention group was lower than the control group . \\n in fact , the mean depression scores of patients in the intervention group in pre - test and post - test indicate the independent role of peplau 's therapeutic communication model in reducing depression in the intervention group ( f=163.27 , p=0.000 ) . such a difference is not observed in the control group . \\n moreover , the depression level in the intervention group four months after the intervention was decreased compared to the control group ( f=20.58 , p=0.000 ) . however , no significant difference was found between two groups in terms of hospital depression two months after intervention ( p=0.61 ) ( table 5 ) . \\n according to the results , peplau 's therapeutic communication is effective in reducing anxiety and depression in patients who were candidate for coronary artery bypass . \\n it resulted in a dramatic decrease in anxiety and depression scores in the intervention group . \\n depression and anxiety are the most important preventive factors in cardiovascular diseases   causing disease rejection by the patient and reduce the incentive to treat and increase the likelihood of disease recurrence [ 25 - 27 ] . \\n most patients with coronary heart disease who survive after surgery resume their normal life after several weeks or several months . \\n previous studies show that patients suffer from anxiety and depression several months and sometimes several years after the surgery [ 26 , 27 , 29 ] . \\n therefore , follow - up and strategies to deal with postoperative psychological complications are of utmost importance . \\n it is not possible except through establishing a coherent and targeted therapeutic communication . indeed , effective communication enables the medical team to identify patients needs and take steps to solve problems and meet their needs . according to dadashi , hosseini and moghaddam ( 2009 ) , staff had close encounters with patients in 85.5% of cases . \\n according to mastaneh and mouseli ( 2013 ) , the rate of respecting patient rights in terms of communication was 60% indicating a moderate level of communication skills . on the other hand , duration and how to communicate with patients , particularly in dealing with patients with chronic diseases are essential in the hope and positive attitude to treatment and follow - up after discharge [ 29 - 31 ] . \\n in fact , the patient gains motivation to cope with illness and trust in nurses through proper therapeutic communication , because the care of patients with either physical or mental illness requires correct and consistent communication [ 30 , 31 ] . \\n therefore , implementing a communication pattern will help medical team to establish a proper communication . \\n peplau 's model is one of these communication patterns . to communicate with patients , especially patients with chronic diseases , \\n peplau 's described four stages and defined roles for the nurse at every step as someone who is in close relationship with the patient [ 16 , 23 ] . \\n peplau 's communication model helps nurses and patient to identify the disease , concerns and questions of the patient . through defining different roles for the nurse \\n this model refers to nursing skills and abilities to establish a simple convenient therapeutic communication . \\n the model enables nurses help the patient after discharge and to spend more time with patient [ 16 , 23 , 24 ] . \\n for example , it has been used in communicating with cancer patients and solving systematic problems of families [ 32 , 33 ] . in this study , \\n peplau 's communication models were employed as communication sessions for patients who were candidates for coronary artery bypass through applying nursing roles . \\n the results showed that holding communication meetings with patients immediately after surgery dramatically reduced hospital anxiety and depression . \\n accordingly , to improve the nurse - patient communication and establish more effective therapeutic communication processes which improves clinical basis and can have a positive impact on the treatment and discharge processes and rehabilitation of patients , especially in patients with chronic diseases , training courses should be included in in - service courses to train and introduce medical team with simple and inexpensive communication skills . \\n furthermore , there is evidence that workshops on communication skills for health team can improve health outcomes and satisfaction of patients . \\n another limitation of this study is the lower percentage of females ( 29.7% ) in the intervention group with respect to the control group ( 51.4% ) . \\n the lower anxiety score in the intervention group could be due to therapeutic communication but also to gender differences . \\n  \\n to write this article not contributed any financial resources and costs are the responsibility of the authors . \\n  \\n all rights of this

. \\n suppurative meningitis ( sm ) , a life - threatening condition , is scarcely observed in subjects with macro tumors secreting prolactin ( prl ) and in other pituitary tumors ( pt ) . \\n however , in some very rare cases it can be a primary presentation or appear after radiotherapy or medical treatment used for tumors destroying the sellar floor and/or the skull base . \\n this destruction leads to cerebral spinal fluid ( csf ) leak , which can act as an entry portal for organisms predisposing to meningitis . \\n our aim was to analyze sm frequency among male mprl deemed to be very

tumor invading cavernous sinuses , the brain and sphenoid sinus ( a ) . \\n after dopamine agonists ( b ) the tumor size was reduced the table 1 shows tumor sizes , hormonal parameters and bromocriptine dose which was used to treat the 4 prolactinomas . \\n when it happens , it is usually observed in post - operative period or after tumor reduction by radiotherapy , apoplexy or medicine intake . \\n the situation is observed in people in whom meninges and sella floor are destroyed by an aggressive pt or an ectopic one arising from the skull base . \\n our 4 cases can be explained by the fact that prolactinomas are the largest and the most invasive pt , especially in males . \\n male prolactinomas often destroy the sellar floor and invade the sphenoid sinus , then the nasopharynx . \\n the meningeal and bony breaches lead to intra and extradural spaces communication , which is responsible for bacterial infection of meninges and encephalic structures . \\n the most difficult differential diagnosis with meningitis occurring in people with pt is pituitary apoplexy , which mimics perfectly bacterial meningitis symptoms . \\n however , a real microbial meningitis with or without rhinorrhea can be observed in apoplexy . \\n the true microbial meningitis secondary to pt is an exceptional phenomenon compared to pituitary apoplexy , which is relatively more frequent . to our best knowledge \\n only 15 sm , revealing pituitary adenomas or appearing under medical treatment have been reported so far . \\n csf leak may proceed or not sm , and can be totally unnoticed . according to lam et al . who analyzed 29 articles published between 1980 and 2011 there were only 52 pt with csf leak . \\n the seven cases were divided in two groups : the primitive meningitis or meningitis occurring prior to any treatment of the pt , and secondary meningitis occurring after surgery and/or dopamine agonists intake as in our 4 observation . \\n our personal research found 15 cases meningitis secondary to pt . if we add our 4 cases , one can totalize 19 cases . in this group \\n most pt were prolactinomas , especially males ones . among this group 14 were primitive . \\n secondary ones ( n = 5 ) appeared under medical treatment , preceded or not by surgery or radiotherapy . \\n sellar floor destruction was obvious on radiographies in all except one case [ table 2 ] . \\n their age ( varying between 22 and 69 years ) did not seem to be a determining factor , but the nature of the adenoma and sphenoid sinus invasion seem fundamental . according to ciatto and to lascelles et al . \\n we find only one case concerning gh adenoma treated by somatostatin 's analogs . a case of recurrent meningitis which appeared many years after neurosurgery was observed in nelson syndrome too . \\n curiously sm was not reported in mixed pt and gonadotroph adenomas which are usually very large and very invasive . \\n contrary to many authors and in agreement with ciatto , we think the association of pituitary adenoma and meningitis is more common than it is generally supposed as we observed it in nearly 5% of our male mprl . \\n so , one should think about it more often even if a cause of sm seems obvious from the first sight as in our 4 case who suffered from chronic otitis . \\n radiological research for pt should be systematic , especially if headaches , visual troubles , and gonadal abnormalities with or without anterior or posterior pituitary deficiencies are present . \\n physicians who deal with large pt should be aware of high risk spontaneous meningitis , but also of secondary sm which can appear 1 month to 4 years or even more after medical treatment initiation by dopamine agonists or somatostatin 's analogs or radiotherapy . on another hand \\n , medical treatment initiation should be gradual , especially for huge tumors as rapid shrinkage may lead to csf leak apparition . \\n if this situation appears , a medical solution may be tried using temporary lumbar puncture or a lumboperitoneal shunt until the bony defect is clogged by fibrosis . \\n if this attitude fails , surgical repair is recommended although the reparation may represent a great challenge because of the many potential sites of the csf around the tumor . if surgical repair in not feasible some authors recommend a vaccination against pathogens of the upper respiratory tract such as streptococcus pneumonia , haemophilus influenza and neisseria meningitidis to prevent sm . \\n three revealed the pt , and one was observed after medical treatment . in 2 cases \\n the described cases emphasize the necessity of an early diagnosis and treatment of large and invasive pt , especially male mprl . medical treatment , which is now the gold standard for prolactinomas , \\n should be gradual and well monitored to avoid rhinorrhea or otorrhea which can lead to potentially fatal bacterial meningitis .\", \"many studies have not been reported in literature for lumbar discectomy by destandau endospine system . \\n we report a series of 300 patients operated for lumbar dissectomy by destandau endospine system . \\n a total of 300 patients suffering from lumbar disc herniations were operated between january 2002 and december 2008 . \\n technique comprised localization of symptomatic level followed by insertion of an endospine system devise through a 15 mm skin and fascial incision . \\n endoscopic discectomy is then carried out by conventional micro disc surgery instruments by minimal invasive route . \\n the results were evaluated by macnab 's criteria after a minimum followup of 12 months and maximum up to 24 months . \\n based on modified macnab 's criteria , 90% patients had excellent to good , 8% had fair , and 2% had poor results . \\n the complications observed were discitis and dural tear in five patients each and nerve root injury in two patients . \\n 90% patients were able to return to light and sedentary work with an average delay of 3 weeks and normal physical activities after 2 months . \\n  \\n the advantages of use of minimal invasive spinal surgical techniques in treatment of lumbar disc herniation is small incision , limited tissue disruption , enhanced visualization due to better magnification and illumination , shorter hospital stay , and faster recovery time.13 among many posterior spinal endoscopic systems used for disc surgery , destandau endospine system and foley and smith 's metrx system are seen as viable alternatives to open disc surgery.46 the aim of this study was to present results in 300 patients operated by edoscopic discectomy and to discuss technical points to shorten the learning curve . \\n a total of 475 patients suffering from different type and level of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy and degenerative lumbar canal stenosis were operated between january 2002 and december 2008 . \\n the inclusion criteria were patients having lumbar disc prolapse with unilateral radiculopathy , on clinical evaluation , positive straight leg raise or femoral stretch test , and identification of a single nerve root lesion on mri . \\n patients with bilateral symptoms , double root involvement , cauda equina syndrome and whose clinical symptoms did not match mri picture were excluded from present study . \\n all these patients had fair trial of conservative treatment in the form of rest , medication ( nsaid ) , activity modification , and physiotherapy ( minimum 6 weeks ) before they were advised to undergo surgery . \\n however , in present study , none of the patients opted for surgery at 6 weeks after completion of conservative treatment . \\n there were 206 males and 94 females aged between 18 to 72 years ( mean , 38.4 years ) . \\n levels operated upon included l1-l2 ( n=3 ) , l2-l3 ( n=2 ) , l3-l4 ( n=6 ) , l4-l5 ( n=205 ) , and l5-s1 ( n=84 ) . \\n there were 235 extruded , 20 contained , 15 foraminal , and 30 sequestrated herniations . \\n results were evaluated as poor , fair , and good or excellent using modified macnab 's criteria . \\n modified macnab 's grading was as follows : excellent - no pain / restriction of activity and being able to do all activities ; good - occasional pain with relief of presenting symptoms and returning to work with some modification ; fair - some improved functional capacity but still handicapped or unemployed ; and poor results - having objective symptoms of root involvement or repeat surgery at the index level . \\n the clinical material included preoperative history , physical examination , plain x - rays and mri studies of lumbosacral spine , laboratory tests , and intraoperative video documentation . \\n postoperative follow - up was carried out on third day , 2 weeks , 6 weeks , 3 , 6 , 12 , and 24 months . \\n it consists of endospine tube , trocar , and working insert [ figure 1a and b ] . \\n one port for 0 degree endoscope , second for suction cannula ,

wound was inspected for any drainage or evidence of infection . complains about fever , backache , and leg discomfort \\n at final follow - up , 90% patients were relieved of sciatica and were satisfied with procedure . \\n 285 patients were operated as day care cases and were mobilized and discharged same evening from day care facility . \\n based on modified macnab 's criteria 90% patients had excellent to good , 8% had fair , and 2% had poor results . \\n five patients who had interaoperative minor dural tears were hospitalized and were observed for any dural leak . \\n causative factor for dural tears in present study were as follows : three patients had dural rent due to forceful retraction of dura and nerve root by dural and nerve root retractor . \\n this was observed in patients in whom there was significant posterolateral herniation resulting in tenting of dura and nerve root at recess . \\n in this situation , authors have found gentle mobilization of nerve root and dura by nerve root hook or approaching and debulking the offending disc through axilla before proceeding with retraction of nerve root and discectomy . \\n this happened when kerrison rongeur was used to open the tight recess resulting in dural tear and nerve root injury . \\n these dural tears were managed by water tight closure of muscle , fascia , and skin and bed rest for duration of one week . \\n superficial delayed wound healing was observed in 20 patients , which healed in 21 days by regular dressings rest and administration of antibiotics . \\n the diagnosis of postsurgical discitis was based on mainly clinical grounds and laboratory evidence of raised counts , esr , and c - reactive proteins . \\n clinical criteria included recurrence of severe and unrelenting back pain within first week of surgery , keeping patient awake at night after initial recovery . \\n no biopsy of disc was resorted to ; however , mri of lumbosacral spine was ordered in all these patients which did not contribute much to the diagnosis . \\n lizolid 600 mg / bd ) for first week followed by oral antibiotics for 5 weeks . \\n all these patients responded well to antibiotics and no further intervention of any kind was carried out . \\n after initial back pain for 6 weeks , these patients had occasional residual backache which was treated by analgesics , activity modification , lumbar support , and rest during subsequent follow - up visits . \\n nerve root injuries ( n=2 ) were encountered while trying to do a medial facetectomy to open the recess by a kerrison rongeur causing severe laceration of nerve root . however , nerve root was in continuity . \\n , patties were used for gentle retraction and procedure of discectomy was successfully completed endoscopically without resorting to open discectomy . \\n 276 patients were able to return to sedentary work with an average delay of 2 weeks , except 24 patients who had complains of backache , occasional leg discomfort , discitis , and nerve root injuries . \\n medial facetectomy was resorted to in 59 patients to open the recess to decompress the nerve root in addition to discectomy . \\n mixter and barr7 discovered the pathophysiology of discogenic sciatica and suggested laminectomy and discectomy as operative treatment . \\n the overall results of standard discectomy range from 68 to 95% in different series.8 the operative microscope and microsurgical techniques were developed in mid-1960 's by yasargil and krayenbuhl910 and these techniques revolutionized spine surgery leading to smaller incisions , less blood loss , increased visualization of site of pathology , decreased hospitalization , shorter postoperative recovery , and earlier return to activities compared with previous operative interventional techniques . \\n the results of microdiscectomy also range from 85 to 98%.1113 katayama et al.14 compared the results of open vs gold standard microdiscectomy and observed no difference between the surgical outcomes in both the groups but microdiscectomy gave better lighting , magnification , and therefore decreased the length of incision and tissue invasion . \\n microdiscectomy also allowed the patients to return to early work with lesser use of narcotic medication . \\n microendoscopic dissectomy ( med ) combines standard microsurgical technique with an endoscope , enabling the surgeons to address all types of disc herniations including decompression of nerve root and lateral recess . \\n chemonucleolysis was reported by smith.15 nonetheless , based upon various randomized clinical trials , the efficacy of chemonucleolysis compared with more traditional and open procedures for the operative treatment of lumbar disc herniations remained speculative.16 the use of percutaneous nucleotomy , laser discectomy , and intradiscal electrothermal annuloplasty ( idet ) compared with microdiscectomy remains unclear , and it is attributed to the lack of high - quality studies.17 conclusions about the efficacy of some of the aforementioned minimally invasive procedures ( e.g. , chemonucleolysis , apd , idet ) were questionable with regard to disc - related pathology.18 therefore , lumbar microdiscectomy remained the gold standard for addressing a herniated or sequestrated intervertebral disc ; however , a movement toward more minimally invasive approaches that would yield superior outcomes , while minimizing excessive soft and bony tissue removal and minimizing soft tissue trauma , were sought . as such , \\n an evolution in procedures toward smaller incisions , less tissue trauma , and quicker return to daily activities took center stage in spine surgery . \\n the use of muscular retractor system was reported initially by faubert and caspar.1920 perez - curet and fessler,21 described for the first time a myriad of spine pathologies that could be addressed using tubeology . \\n though from our initial experience , endospine technique is minimal invasive , but limitation of study has been lack of comparison with gold standard microscopic discectomy technique . \\n however , in a study by shin et al.,22 15 cases each were compared of med and microscopic group ( md ) . \\n the mean cpk - mm levels were lower for the med group than for the md group at both 3 ( 576.1286.3 iu / l compared with 968.1377.8 \\n iu / l ) and 5 days ( 348.1231.0 iu / l compared with 721.7463.2 ) postoperatively ( p<0.05 ) . the mean vas scores for postoperative back pain were lower in the med group than in the md group , both at 1 ( 3.32.3 compared with 5.81.5 ) and 5 days ( 1.91.1 compared with 3.61.1 ) postoperatively ( p<0.01 ) . \\n aforementioned authors concluded that the med procedure is less invasive than md , and causes less muscle damage and backache . \\n the 90% excellent results in present study is comparable with other surgical procedures for herniated lumbar discs such as those of destandau , perez - cruet et al . , and \\n their average surgical time was 66 minutes , average blood loss was 22 ml , average hospital stay was 7.7 hours , complication rate was 5% , reoperation rate was 4% , and average return to work was 17 days with excellent result in 94% patients . \\n average operative time was 50 minutes average blood loss was 45 ml ( range , 30 - 70 ml ) . \\n return to work ( 21 days ) and overall results ( 90% ) which are comparable . in another prospective and randomized evaluation of surgical treatment for lumbar disc herniation by hermantin et al.,24 satisfactory results of 97% in endoscopic group ( n=30 ) and 93% in open laminectomy group ( n=30 ) were reported . \\n however , in endoscopic group , these authors had excluded large central herniations and extra ligamentous herniations between l5 and first sacral vertebra . \\n however , present endoscopic technique could be used for all levels and all type of herniations . in our current series , there was 5% discitis and 5% incidence of dural injury . \\n caspar and ebling,2526 authors have reported reoperation rate of 5.5 , 5.7 , and 3% , respectively . \\n another measure of success is reflected by the patient 's ability to return to previous employment . \\n our patients returned to previous employment on an average at 15 days with restriction to avoid heavy manual work for 2 months . \\n discectomy ( med ) by endospine system has claimed even lesser tissue invasion than microdiscectomy with even smaller skin incision , lesser use of analgesics , and early return to work . \\n least tissue invasion is established by many reports comparing the postoperative mri signal of paraspinal muscles,27 intraoperative electromyographic findings establishing less invasion to nerve roots,28 and by measuring serum levels of biochemical parameters reflective of a postoperative inflammatory reaction and damage to the paravertebral muscles.29 our personal opinion is similar , though this was not the parameter studied in our series . \\n minimal invasive microendoscopic decompression technique has been used not only for paracentral disc herniations , but also for all types including far lateral , cephalad , caudal migrated , and central and recurrent disc herniations.3032 one of the driving forces behind the minimal invasive spine surgery is economics , shorter hospital stay , reduced postoperative morbidity , and quicker recovery times . in our series , 90% patients were operated as day care cases . \\n posterior paraspinous process endoscopic access to lumbar disc herniation requires creation of working space where no or little space existed before . \\n internal view of operating site is magnified and well illuminated . with advent of this system , \\n discectomy can be done as day care procedure ensuring reduced postoperative morbidity , minimal or no hospitalization , less pain , and faster recovery . \\n with proper patient selection , discectomy and adequate nerve root decompression by doing foraminotomy or opening a lateral recess stenosis by minimally invasive technique can be achieved with this system . \\n however , the endospine system has been excellent modality to address discogenic radiculopathy and to decompress lumbar canal stenosis . \\n many surgeons are convinced of advantages of the system and have included this system as part of their inventry . however , due to difficulty in orientation with scope and two - dimensional vision , availability of less space , frustrating and steep learning curve , and inability to master hand eye coordination , majority of surgeons are not able to continue with the technique . \\n the patience and persvrance to work through narrow confines and work closely with a surgeon who has mastered the technique is the key to learn . \\n second step would be to become comfortable with 2 dimensional vision of endoscopic camera and to master orientation , triangulation . \\n depth perception in these techniques comes from experience rather than observation ; hence , surgeon keen to learn these techniques must combine these procedures during early phase of learning with standard procedures he is doing in his clinical practice . gradually , as surgeons master the learning curve , he will be able to use this as treatment method for his patients . \\n there is also a need to establish cadaveric labs and dummy models on line of arthroscopic learning centers where surgeons can practice hands - on cadavers and models to improve triangulation , depth perception , and hand eye coordination .\", 'the femoral head often leads to healing complications , while the more predictable prosthetic replacements are associated with poorer function and significant complications . \\n the treatment of these fractures depends on the age of the patient , fracture displacement , bone quality , timing of surgery and activity level of the patient . \\n displaced fractures in healthy , active patients are best treated by reduction and internal fixation . \\n there are however , complications unique to femoral neck fractures which are almost impossible to predict . non - union and avascular necrosis \\n non - union usually can definitely diagnosed within a year of fracture fixation with the same being achieved within 3  months at times . after non - union has been established , intervention is inevitable . \\n the decision to proceed in the management of failed fixation is based on the careful consideration of various factors . in young patients \\n revision internal fixation with cancellous or muscle pedicle bone grafting ( vascularised bone graft ) or an osteotomy results in useful outcome . \\n we report a case of non - union of the fracture of the neck of the femur , who refused additional procedures after his non - union had been established . \\n the study conforms to the declaration of helsinki and was approved by the institutional ethical board . \\n a 38-year old male businessman reported to the out door department of our hospital with a history of a fall from height . \\n clinical and radiological examination revealed a displaced fracture of the neck of the femur which was graded as garden type 4 ( fig . \\n the patient was operated within 24  h. intraoperatively the garden alignment index was used as a yardstick of acceptable reduction . \\n the fracture was fixed with 3 ao 6.5  mm cannulated screws in an inverted triangle . \\n onward the patient complained of persistent but mild groin pain on ambulation which was assisted . \\n the patients conservative line was continued till 1  year when his symptoms continued and radiologically there was no progress . at this point \\n twenty - six  months into the post operative followup the patients pain subsided and radiographs started showing signs of union . a radiograph taken 32  months after the fixation showed full union . \\n non - union after femoral neck fracture can be defined as a lack of radiographic evidence of union 6  months after the fracture . \\n delayed or non - union often manifests as continued pain with weight bearing beyond 3  months post fixation . \\n incidence of non - union of femoral neck fractures has been reported to be between 2 and 22% and generally becomes apparent within 1  year [ 69 ] . \\n 3radiograph at 32  months depicting union garden 4 type fracture of the neck of the femur showing persistent non - union at 2  years radiograph at 32  months depicting union anatomical reduction and rigid internal fixation are the two important surgeon controlled factors that may contribute to outcome . \\n the preferred treatment for symptomatic non - unions in the elderly is prosthetic replacement . in the young active patients , \\n if failure is due to technical errors , revision open reduction and internal fixation may be adequate . \\n our case demonstrates that as long as the implant is holding and the patient is regularly followed up good results might be expected in cases as far as 32  months into the post fixation period .', 'granuloma faciale ( gf ) is an uncommon , benign , inflammatory skin disorder of unknown etiology . \\n it is characterized by single or multiple , grey - brown or violaceous nodules or plaques primarily occurring on the face and occasionally at extra - facial sites . \\n the disease is notoriously resistant to therapies and often tends to relapse when treatment is discontinued . \\n we present a patient with multiple lesions of gf and its response to topical tacrolimus . \\n a 35-year - old female presented to our department with a 5 year history of single , asymptomatic , grey - brown pigmented , nodule over the left cheek [ figure 1

and personal history was unremarkable . before treatment  single , grey - brown nodule with prominent follicular orifices over left cheek . \\n after treatment  residual lesion after three months of tacrolimus application general physical and systemic examination was normal . \\n cutaneous examination revealed multiple , well - defined , grey - brown , indurated , non - tender plaques , varying in size from 0.5 cm  0.5 cm to 1.5 cm  2.5 cm , present on the left cheek , left forehead , both arms and upper back . \\n multiple grey - brown plaques over upper back routine hematological and biochemical investigations were normal . \\n skin biopsy ( 4 mm ) from plaque revealed normal epidermis with clear sub epidermal \\n grenz zone and pan dermal dense infiltrate comprising of neutrophils , lymphocytes , histiocytes and plasma cells . \\n small dermal vessels showed infiltration of neutrophils in the vessel wall along with peri - appendageal and peri - neural infiltrate in subcutaneous fat [ figure 3 ] . \\n ( h and e , 100  ) skin biopsy with normal epidermis and dense , mixed inflammatoey infiltrate beneath a narrow grenz zone in the dermis . \\n infiltrate is composed of mononuclear cells with neutrophils and eosinophils she was started on intralesional triamcilone acetonide 10 mg / ml injection monthly with tab . \\n six sessions of cryotherapy were performed once monthly after which she developed erythema and itching over the plaques and discontinued treatment . \\n the lesions showed 40 - 50% improvement after 3 months of therapy [ figure 1 ] . \\n classically , red - brown or violaceous nodules or plaques with associated telangiectasia and follicular accentuation are seen on the face over sun - exposed sites . \\n differential diagnosis includes lupus pernio , lupus vulgaris , lymphoma , discoid lupus erythematosus and deep mycotic infection . \\n skin biopsy is characterized by a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with a predominance of neutrophils and eosinophils in the dermis , in conjunction with small vessel vasculitis . \\n there is a grenz zone that separates the infiltrate from the epidermis and pilosebaceous units . \\n the disease is notoriously resistant to therapies and often tends to relapse once the treatment is discontinued . \\n several medical and surgical modalities like topical and intralesional corticosteroids , cryotherapy , pulsed dye laser , puva , systemic corticosteroids , dapsone and antimalarials have been tried with variable success rates . \\n carbon dioxide laser has also been used in a case of recurrent gf . surgical excision has been performed with often unsatisfactory results . \\n ablative procedures may leave residual pigmentation and scarring , whereas long - term application of corticosteroids is associated with skin atrophy , telangiectasia and other possible adverse effects . in recent years successes with topical calcineurin inhibitors has been reported . \\n several authors have reported complete or near - complete resolution of lesions after application of topical tacrolimus 0.1% ointment.[48 ] treatment regimens , duration and time to resolution of lesions have varied in these case reports [ table 1 ] . \\n others have found time to resolution to be between 4 and 6 months . in our patient , \\n treatment with tacrolimus 0.1% ointment twice daily for 3 months has resulted in improvement . reported cases of successful treatment of granuloma faciale ( gf ) with topical tacrolimus tacrolimus \\n inhibits t - cell proliferation , production and release of several pro - inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-2 ( il-2 ) , il-4 , tumor necrosis factor - alpha , and interferon - gamma ( ifn - gamma ) . \\n although the pathogenesis is still unknown , it has been suggested that gf may be an ifn - gamma mediated disease . \\n in addition , an increased production of il-5 , probably induced by the clonal expansion of a locally recruited t - cell population may enhance the attraction of eosinophils into the lesions of gf . \\n therefore , a possible mechanism of action of topical tacrolimus in this condition may be the inhibition of ifn - gamma and il-5 production and release , induced by the down - regulation of the t - cell activity , primarily involving the calcineurin binding and inactivation . \\n however , we did observe eosinophils in skin biopsy in our case , probably since the biopsy was taken after one year of oral dapsone . \\n our patient experienced a relevant improvement within 3 months of treatment with tacrolimus ointment after no response with intra lesional steroids , dapsone and cryo therapy . in conclusion \\n , the previous reports and our observation suggest that topical tacrolimus may be a well - tolerated , efficacious therapy for gf .', \"chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia ( cmmol ) is a rare disease with an incidence of 0.370.72 per 100 000 population . the median age at diagnosis varies between 65 years and 75 years [ 14 ] . \\n the radical treatment is allogeneic stem cell transplantation , although this treatment is unsuitable for most patients because of their advanced age [ 6 , 7 ] . \\n the median survival of patients with cmmol is 1520 months [ 5 , 6 , 8 ] . \\n several case reports have indicated that excess surgical stress causes an acute blastic crisis , which contributes to a poor outcome [ 9 , 10 ] . \\n a 68-year - old man complained of having a reduced appetite for approximately 5 months and weight loss during the previous 4 months . on 12 may 2012 \\n , he visited a nearby general internal medicine clinic for the evaluation of left lower quadrant abdominal pain . \\n he was referred to the department of internal medicine at asahi general hospital ( asahi , japan ) for investigation and treatment . \\n he began taking oral hydroxyurea ( hydrea ; bristol - myers squibb , princeton , nj , usa ) . \\n he was unable to stop the gingival bleeding that had been ongoing for 5 hours . \\n he then visited the emergency department of asahi general hospital and was referred to the department of dentistry and oral surgery . at the initial visit \\n the right molar teeth ( 47 and 48 ) showed grade iii mobility , and their gingivae were painful with continuous bleeding . \\n 1a ) . the right molar teeth ( 46 and 47 ) showed class iii alveolar ridge

\\n ( b ) the oral photograph after the extraction of teeth 47 and 48 . \\n ( a ) the oral photograph at the initial visit , immediately after the gauze with the astringent has been removed . \\n the internal medicine department assigned a clinical diagnosis of cmmol , based on the blood and bone marrow examinations conducted on 13 june 2012 . \\n computed tomography on june 25 indicated that bone absorption had nearly reached the right inferior alveolar canal , and a ring of sequestrum was present under tooth 47 ( fig . \\n we diagnosed right mandibular osteomyelitis , based on these clinical features . on 11 july 2012 , \\n the patient was hospitalized in the department of haematology ward because of significant anaemia and decreased platelet numbers . on the same day , \\n the internal medicine specialist placed him on intravenous  piperacillin  tazobactam ( zosyn ; pfizer , new york , ny , usa ) . \\n he afterwards complained of severe pain in the socket ( 47 and 48 ) , despite receiving the potent opioid analgesic dihydrohydroxycodeinone ( fentanyl ; daiichi - sankyo , chiyoda - ku , tokyo , japan ) . \\n hence , we decided to apply a surgical anti - inflammatory treatment in consideration of an acute blastic crisis . \\n a bone marrow examination on july 13 showed no signs of acute blastic crisis of his cmmol . \\n after we consulted an internal medicine specialist , we planned a surgical procedure to clean the inflamed region in his mouth . on the day before the surgery \\n , he was administered a transfusion of platelet concentrate ( 20 units ) and piperacillin  tazobactam to prevent bleeding and further infection . on july 20 , with the patient under local anaesthesia , we surgically resected the right lower sequestrum and extracted molar 37 , which displayed severe caries . \\n the blood examination indicated improvement in the platelet count after the transfusion . after performing an inferior alveolar block \\n , we removed the necrotic bone with ultrasonic bone surgery ( variosurg ; nsk , ashikaga , tochigi , japan ) until there was bleeding from the bone surface ( fig . \\n we placed gauze with tetracycline ointment in the socket and

admitted himself to the hospital in the haematology ward because of exertional dyspnoea . \\n the internal medicine specialists diagnosed cmmol that was undergoing acute leukaemic transformation by bone marrow examination . \\n he died on 10 february 2013 because of cardiac arrest , following haemorrhagic shock and cardiovascular failure due to cmmol . \\n in all patients with cmmol , every effort must be made to use the least invasive procedure possible . in the present patient , \\n our deepest concerns were to have a proper balance between invasiveness and healing , and to avoid evoking an acute blastic crisis [ 9 , 10 ] . \\n our most important goal was to alleviate the patient 's discomfort by using a minimally invasive procedure to eliminate infection . based on haematology results , \\n the oral surgery did not trigger the acute blastic crisis of cmmol in this patient . \\n the surgery was necessary to improve his oral environment and to prevent further infection and more pain . because cmmol is associated with a risk of acute blastic crisis and a poor prognosis , any surgical procedure in these patients must be considered on a case - by - case basis . \\n \", 'moraxella catarrhalis is a gram - negative , aerobic diplococcus human mucosal pathogen which causes middle ear infections in infants and children [ 13 ] , and it is one of the three major causes of otitis media along with streptococcus pneumonia and haemophilus influenzae . although moraxella catarrhalis is frequently found as a commensal of the upper respiratory tract , recently it has emerged as a genuine pathogen and is now considered an important cause of upper respiratory tract infections in healthy children and elderly people , lower respiratory tract infections in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ 1 , 5 ] , and hospital - acquired pneumonia . \\n amikacin , cefixime , fosfomycin , cefuroxime , cotrimoxazole , doxycycline , and erythromycin resistant strains of moraxella catarrhalis were isolated and the widespread production of a -1actamase enzyme renders the bacterium resistant to the penicillin [ 79 ] . \\n this has led to the search for new and effective therapeutic alternatives among natural compounds . \\n plants remain an important source of diverse chemical entities which have been used as drugs or provide scaffolds from which new drugs have been derived . \\n the selection of a suitable candidate species for investigations can be done on the basis of long - term use by humans . \\n this approach is based on an assumption that the active compounds isolated from such plants are likely to be safer than those derived from plant species with no history of human use . \\n aristolochia is an important genus in the family of aristolochiaceae and is widespread across tropical asia , africa , and south america . \\n it is used in traditional medicine as a gastric stimulant and in the treatment of cancer , lung inflammation , dysentery , and snakebites . \\n it is also used in the treatment of tumors and malaria and for fevers , but its usage as an antimalarial is not recommended in its crude form . \\n aristolochia bracteolata showed a definite positive effect on wound healing , with significant increase in the level of powerful antioxidant enzymes . \\n the whole plant was used as a purgative , antipyretic , and anti - inflammatory . \\n organic solvent extracts of the plant showed antibacterial activities while the water extract showed antifungal activity . \\n although aristolochia has been used for thousands of years in many cultures for many indications due to its various pharmacological activities , it was later discovered that consuming these plants can certainly be dangerous . \\n the genus of aristolochia contains a naturally carcinogenic compound aa which has been shown to be the cause of so - called chinese herb nephropathy or aa nephropathy [ 19 , 20 ] , and mutations in the cells of people who consume it , causes more mutations than two of the best - known environmental carcinogens : tobacco smoke and uv light [ 21 , 22 ] . \\n there are many cases of nephropathy reported in the literature caused by the systemic and long term application of chinese snakeroot ( aristolochia fangchi ) ; this highlighted the risk of using preparations which contain aristolochic acids . \\n although aristolochia is being known in many countries that is containing a toxic compound aa , but this has not stopped it from being a popular herbal remedy for thousands of years . \\n it is still extensively used in india and in traditional chinese medicine for slimming , menstrual symptoms , and rheumatism . \\n it is also widespread used in sudan and other african countries as one of the most effective herbal remedies for infectious diseases . \\n therefore , it was our objective to assess the potential antimicrobial activity of aristolochia bracteolata using a bioassay - guided fractionation , in order to produce pure compound that can act as the lead compound in developing new , safe , and effective drug to replace the use of the harmful crude plant material . \\n sephadex

tested bacteria ( 100  l of 10  cfu / ml ) was spread onto solid media plates . \\n the sterile paper discs ( 6  mm in diameter ) which were impregnated with the plant extract ( 14  mg ) and pure compound ( 10100  g ) were placed aseptically over the bacterial culture on nutrient agar plates . \\n after incubation at 37c for 24 hours , the zone of inhibition around the discs was measured by millimeter scale . \\n sterile , blank paper discs impregnated with only sterile solvents served as negative control each time . \\n the sterile paper discs ( 6  mm in diameter ) which were impregnated with individual extract were placed on the inoculated plates . \\n these plates were incubated for 2472  h at 2528c and the growth was evaluated visually by comparing a particular plate with the negative control plates ( having only test fungi ) . \\n the antifungal activity was evaluated by measuring the inhibition zone diameter ( in millimeter ) observed . \\n the mic and mbc values were determined by broth dilution method in accordance with clsi methodology . \\n bacterial strains were cultured for 24  h at 37c on nutrient broth and then suspended in sterile distilled water to give a final inoculum concentration of 1.5  1.0  10  cfu / ml . \\n dilutions ranging from 1.56 to 400  g / ml of the compound were prepared in tubes including broth and dmso 10% ( v / v ) , in addition to one negative control ( broth + dmso 10% v / v + test microorganism ) to ensure that the final concentration of dmso in the assays did not interfere with the bacterial growth and one sterility control ( broth + dmso 10% v / v + test compound ) . \\n a 100  l suspension of test microorganism was added to individual tubes and incubated at 37c for 24  h. the mic of the compound was defined as the lowest concentration that inhibited the visible bacterial growth and the mbc was defined as the lowest concentration that prevented the growth of the organism after subculture onto antibiotic - free plates . \\n initial steps in new drug discovery involve identification of new chemical entities , which can be either sourced through chemical synthesis or can be isolated from natural products through biological activity guided fractionation . \\n bioassay - guided fractionation of the identified plant may lead to standardized extract or isolated bioactive lead compounds as the new drug . \\n the whole plant of aristolochia bracteolata was extracted successively with meoh and subjected to liquid - liquid fractionation with n - hexane , chloroform , ethyl acetate , and n - butanol . \\n the resulting fractions were tested for antibacterial and antifungal activities . the crude extract and chloroform fraction were significantly active against sea urchin - derived bacillus sp . and both standard strain and clinical isolates of moraxella catarrhalis and were moderately active against s. aureus , b. subtilis , and ps . \\n the n - hexane fraction had moderate activity against s. aureus and b. subtilis while ethyl acetate fraction showed moderate activity against ps . \\n the crude extract failed to inhibit the growth of all test fungi in addition to the following bacterial strains : klebsiella pneumoniae , escherichia coli , salmonella typhimurium , streptococcus pyogenes , streptococcus agalactiae , staphylococcus epidermidis , neisseria lactamicus , enterobacter cloacae , bacillus cereus , aeromonas hydrophila , salmonella typhi , vibrio cholerae , and yersinia enterocolitica . \\n the chloroform soluble fraction was therefore selected for further chromatographic separations and resulted in the isolation of known compound aa-1 ( figure 1 ) . \\n aa-1 showed strong activity against moraxella catarrhalis ( standard strain and clinical isolates ) and sea urchin - derived bacillus sp . \\n ( table 2 ) , with equal mic and mbc values of 25 and 50  g / ml . both the piperonylic acid moiety of aa-1 ( figure 1 ) and aa-1-methyl ester showed no activity against bacteria ( table 2 ) , which suggests that the coexistence of phenanthrene ring and free carboxylic acid is essential for aa-1 antibacterial activity . \\n bioguided fractionation of methanolic extract of aristolochia bracteolata led to isolation of aa-1 and its structure was elucidated by interpretation of its nmr and ms data and by comparison with those reported in the literature . \\n electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( esims ) showed pseudomolecular ion signal at m / z 364.03 [ m + na ] and high resolution fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry ( hr - fabms ) afforded m+1 ion signal at m / z 342.0620 which was corresponding to the molecular formula c17h12no7 ( calculated for 342.06138 ) . \\n h nmr and c - nmr spectra were matched with those of aa-1 which were previously reported . \\n two weak signals which did not show any correlation with proton in hsqc and hmbc spectroscopy were considered as quaternary carbons at positions 5 (  124.3  ppm ) and 6 (  143.5  ppm ) , respectively . \\n laboratories of the world have found literally thousands of phytochemicals which have inhibitory effects on all types of microorganisms in vitro . \\n more of these compounds should be subjected to animal and human studies to determine their effectiveness in whole - organism systems , including in particular toxicity studies and an examination of their effects on beneficial normal microbiota . in spite of \\n the fact that herbal remedy is a mixture of many chemicals in unknown doses and might result in unpleasant side effects , many people believe that treatments that are natural are somehow magically safe and effective . \\n aristolochia is used in traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases [ 13 , 15 ] , including those associated with bacteria . \\n this study showed clearly that the excellent effect of aristolochia in treating such diseases is due to the toxic compound aa-1 . \\n although aa-1 is highly effective in killing m. catarrhalis , it is ineffective against the other microorganisms tested . \\n this highlights the importance of m. catarrhalis in discovering the cellular target of aa-1 and the mechanism of aa-1 toxicity . \\n the widespread use of aristolochia is not sufficient to ensure that it is effective or even that it is safe . \\n therefore , hit - to - lead exploration is necessary to identify related compounds with low toxicity , low cost , and improved potency that can replace the use of the harmful crude plant material . \\n it is impossible to ban the use of these remedies , especially in the rural areas in sudan and other african countries ; therefore , we strongly recommend educating the public of the risks versus the benefits of aristolochia and gradually replacing them with either economical new drugs or standardized extracts and homogenous batches of other plant material with known levels of safe active constituents . \\n using bioassay - guided fractionation technique , the present study directly linked the antibacterial activity of aristolochia bracteolata to the aa-1 . \\n although aa-1 had strong activity against m. catarrhalis , it had a narrow spectrum of activity than expected based on the activity of the crude extract from which it was isolated or from its traditional usage . \\n this may be the result of synergism between different compounds in the complex extracts or may be due to placebo effect .', \"anti - neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ( ancas ) correlate well with a wide spectrum of vasculitis manifestations , including wegener 's granulomatosis , microscopic polyangiitis , and churg - strauss syndrome , all of which are commonly referred to as anca - associated vasculitis ( 1 ) . \\n several infections , particularly infective endocarditis , have been reported to show positive findings on anca tests ; furthermore , their clinical features have been acknowledged to mimic anca - associated vasculitis ,

endovascular stent graft repair . \\n in this case , an infected aortic aneurysm exhibited elevated the patient 's pr3-anca level , and its clinical course mimicked pr3-anca - associated vasculitis . \\n the detection of ancas is highly specific for a diagnosis of anca - associated vasculitis ( 4 ) ; however , a number of infections can result in a positive anca test . \\n there are several reports of infective endocarditis with the presence of ancas that mimic the clinical manifestations of an anca - associated vasculitis such as glomerulonephritis ( 2,3 ) . in the present case , based on the finding of positive blood cultures \\n , we suspected that the patient was experiencing not anca - associated vasculitis but infective endocarditis . \\n however , no vegetations were detected in the cardiac chambers using transthoracic echocardiography or transesophageal echocardiography . \\n instead , contrast - enhanced ct revealed a pseudoaneurysm in the descending aorta , which suggested that the patient had an infected aneurysm . \\n her renal dysfunction and elevated pr3-anca levels normalized with clinical resolution of the infected aneurysm after the administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy and evar . \\n the patient has remained free of any evidence of systemic vasculitis during follow - up . \\n the presence of pr3-anca may have been falsely positive in the present patient . to our knowledge , this is the first report of an infected aortic aneurysm with a positive pr3-anca test and clinical features mimicking anca - associated vasculitis . \\n the presence of vegetations in the heart is one of the most characteristic findings of infective endocarditis . \\n these vegetations are composed of bacteria , platelets , and inflammatory cells interspersed with fibrin mesh , either on damaged endocardium , including native cardiac valves , or prosthetic valves ( 5 ) . in the present case , \\n because these masses disappeared after antibiotic treatment , they were considered to be vegetations . a pathological examination of the macular hemorrhages on the patient 's sole indicated not a cholesterol embolization but rather a janeway lesion , which was the consequence of septic embolic events . \\n we therefore suspected that these masses were not mobile plaques but bacterial vegetations . to our knowledge , \\n few cases of infected native aortic aneurysm manifesting vegetations in the aneurysm have been reported ( 6 - 8 ) . \\n several mechanisms have been proposed regarding how ancas are formed during the course of infection , such as autoantigen complementarity , molecular mimicry , epigenetics , neutrophil extracellular traps , and microbial - sensing proteins called toll - like receptors ( 9 ) . there may be a great degree of overlap in the clinical and laboratory manifestations between anca - associated vasculitis and anca - positive infected aortic aneurysm , potentially leading to a misdiagnosis . \\n it is important to correctly diagnose these cases in order to avoid administering inappropriate therapy , such as immunosuppressive treatment , which might have life - threatening consequences in a patient with an infected aortic aneurysm . \\n positive blood cultures and imaging findings , such as a pseudoaneurysm and/or vegetations in the aorta , suggest the presence of an infected aortic aneurysm . a combination of conventional surgical treatment with resection of the aneurysm , extensive local debridement , and revascularization by in situ reconstruction or extra - anatomic bypass may be the gold standard , but such a treatment strategy is accompanied by a high mortality and morbidity . in the present case , \\n it was recently reported that evar of an infected aortic aneurysm is feasible and , for most patients , a durable treatment option ( 10 ) . \\n given that the continuous administration of antibiotics for the infected aneurysm should prevent a recurrence of local infection , we continued using antibiotics until the infection was controlled and carefully monitored the shape of the pseudoaneurysm on contrast - enhanced ct . \\n we were ready to perform an emergency surgical correction at any point during this patient 's treatment course . in conclusion \\n , we herein reported an unusual case of infected descending aortic pseudoaneurysm with luminal pathognomonic oscillating vegetation and with serological findings and clinical features mimicking pr3-anca - associated vasculitis . \\n \", 'endometriosis is a prevalent cause of infertility , pelvic pain , dysmenorrhea , and dyspareunia in reproductive - age women . \\n its diagnosis is by inspection of the pelvis during laparoscopy . in women with pelvic pain and infertility , \\n endometriosis mimics some autoimmune and malignant diseases , including familial occurrence and immunological abnormalities in b and t cells , increased angiogenesis , invasion of endometrial cells to adjacent organs ( e.g. , bladder and bowels ) , and need for repeat surgeries due to recurrence [ 1,57 ] . \\n multiple mechanisms for etiology and improvement of endometriosis are suggested and the treatments are based on these unclear mechanisms . therefore , progestin , gnrh agonists and antagonists , and drugs related to lipid metabolism ( e.g. , simvastatin ) are used for treatment . \\n it has been shown that inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of endometriosis , so endometriosis treatment should not be different from that of other inflammatory disorders \\n . there may be a correlation between vitamin d levels and the risk of polycystic ovarian disease , endometriosis , breast and ovarian cancer , increased arterial stiffness in older patients , and myasthenia gravis [ 1218 ] . \\n it has been found that vitamin d has a role in normal cellular growth regulation . \\n vitamin d increases anti - inflammatory cytokines production and decreases pro - inflammatory cytokines [ 1922 ] . \\n vitamin d induces apoptosis and suppression of angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo [ 2528 ] . \\n although an indirect relationship between vitamin d and endometriosis has been reported in multiple studies , here has been no published randomized clinical trial on endometriosis and vitamin d treatment in women . \\n we explored the relationship between vitamin d and endometriosis in a double - blind , randomized clinical trial looking at the effect of vitamin d supplementation on cessation of pain in proven endometriosis after laparoscopic diagnosis and treatment . \\n this randomized , double - blind clinical trial was performed in a single tertiary university hospital from nov 2014 to feb 2016 . to find patients with endometriosis , we did laparoscopy for various indications , including ovarian cyst , infertility , pelvic pain , and dysmenorrhea . \\n using laparoscopy , the surgeons diagnosed patients with endometriosis and tried to excise or ablate all diseased tissue . the day before laparoscopy \\n , a data collection form was completed by a physician , including the reason for laparoscopy , and the severity of pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea were estimated using a visual analogue scale test ( vas test ) , with a score of 0 being no pain and a score 10 being the worst pain ever experienced . \\n the laparoscopies were done by 2 gynecologic laparoscopic surgeons ; both were involved in each operation and they recorded the severity of endometriosis according to the revised american society for reproductive medicine ( asrm ) classification . in the patients with endometriosis in the second menses after laparoscopic diagnosis and treatment , the vas test was repeated . \\n patients with vas scores of at least 3 for dysmenorrhea and/or pelvic pain were invited to participate in this clinical trial , and after consultation we asked them to sign the informed consent . \\n the dyspareunia score was not a criterion for entering the study because some of the patients were not married and had not had intercourse . \\n women aged 1540 years with proven endometriosis by laparoscopy and a vas test score of 3 or more for dysmenorrhea

hypertension , diabetes , coronary , renal , and hepatic diseases ) ; patients with known malignancy ; patients with hormonal treatment , including oral contraceptive pills , in the last 6 months . after authorization by the university ethics committee , \\n eligible patients were assigned by simple randomization to receive either vitamin d or placebo . in the vitamin d group ( d group ) , we prescribed oral vitamin d 50 000 iu / weekly for 12 weeks ( capsule d - vigel , vitamin d3 50 000 iu , daana pharma co. tabriz - iran ) and in the placebo group ( p group ) we prescribed 1 capsule of placebo ( daana pharma co. tabriz - iran ) weekly for 12 weeks . \\n four weeks after the end of the intervention ( 24 weeks after surgical treatment ) , the vas test was repeated for the 2 groups .

gynecologic patients , and endometriosis was diagnosed in 75 . at the second menses after diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopy , 40 cases met the inclusion criteria for our study . \\n the remaining 39 cases were randomly assigned in vitamin d ( n=19 ) or placebo treatment ( n=20 ) groups . \\n one patient in the placebo group became pregnant at the third month after the operation and discontinued placebo treatment . at the end of the study , we had 19 patients in each group ( figure 1 ) . \\n table 1 shows a baseline comparison between the 2 study groups for general characteristics , reason for laparoscopy , severity of endometriosis , and severity of dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain . \\n causes of laparoscopy in women with endometriosis diagnosed by laparoscopy were dysmenorrhea ( n=28 ) , ovarian cyst ( n=23 ) , chronic pelvic pain ( n=19 ) , and infertility ( n=9 ) . in some patients , there was more than 1 reason for laparoscopy . \\n severity of endometriosis in 45% was moderate ( n=17 ) and 47% had severe endometriosis ( n=18 ) . before laparoscopy , \\n the mean pelvic pain score in the vitamin d group was 4.053.45 and 4.824.1(p=0.513 ) in the placebo group . before laparoscopy , the mean dysmenorrhea pain score in the vitamin d group was 7.372.61 and in placebo group it was 6.423.04 ( p=0.325 ) . table 2 shows a comparison between the 2 groups for severity of pelvic pain and/or dysmenorrhea at different time points ( before laparoscopy , in second menses after laparoscopy , and at 24 weeks after laparoscopy ) . at the second menses after laparoscopy , there was no significant difference between the 2 groups for pelvic pain ( p=0.583 ) and dysmenorrhea ( p=0.365 ) , and at 24 weeks after laparoscopy there was no significant difference between mean pain scores in the 2 groups . mean pelvic pain at 24 weeks after laparoscopy in the vitamin d group was 0.841.74 and in placebo group it was 0.681.70 ( p=0.513 ) . \\n mean dysmenorrhea was 2.102.33 in the vitamin d group and 2.732.84 in the placebo group ( p=0.45 ) . \\n all of the patients had good cooperation for follow - up and continued their treatment until the end of the study . \\n in this double - blind , randomized clinical trial , at 24 weeks after laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis there was no significant difference between effect of vitamin d3 ( cholecalciferol ) and placebo on severity of dysmenorrhea and/or pelvic pain . \\n this is the first clinical trial on women with endometriosis to explore the possible relationship between vitamin d treatment and relief of endometriosis - related pain . \\n our literature search found only studies that were indirectly related to vitamin d and endometriosis [ 2743 ] . \\n the etiology of endometriosis is poorly understood , and many etiologic factors have been suggested , including the serum level of 1 , 25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 . \\n 1 , 25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 is a fat - soluble vitamin with an unclear role in endometriosis . \\n it is suggested that nuclear vitamin d receptors can have a regulatory role in inflammation and can be used as an index of cellular metabolic health . a study on vitamin d receptor gene polymorphism in endometriosis compared 132 infertile women with endometriosis with 132 fertile women , reporting no significant difference and suggesting that vitamin d receptor gene polymorphism does not play an important role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis . in some studies , \\n higher plasma levels of 1 , 25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 and higher intake of dairy foods was associated with lower risk of endometriosis . \\n conversely , another study compared serum vitamin d levels of 87 women with endometriosis with 53 women without endometriosis ; the mean serum levels of 1 , 25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 in women with and without endometriosis were 24.914.8 ng / ml and 20.411.8 , respectively ( p=0.05 ) and the study concluded that endometriosis is associated with higher serum levels of vitamin d . \\n a systematic review of 10 case - control studies and 1 cohort study on women s diet found that women with endometriosis had lower consumption of vegetables and omega-3 , and reported a significant association between diet and endometriosis . \\n vitamin d binding protein ( dbp ) is a plasma glycoprotein that modulates immune and inflammatory responses and also controls transport of vitamin d metabolites and bone development . in a study \\n comparing 13 ectopic endometrial tissues and 6 normal endometrial tissues , vitamin d binding protein was significantly higher in the ectopic endometrial tissues ( p<0.05 ) . \\n a systematic review of research from 1946 to 2013 on vitamin d and endometriosis reported that women with endometriosis had higher serum levels of vitamin d binding protein . \\n another study compared serum and peritoneal levels of dbp in 26 women with endometriosis and 17 women with other benign gynecological conditions and reported that women with endometriosis had higher serum levels of dbp than in the control group . \\n a study comparing urinary levels of dbp in 57 women with endometriosis with levels in 38 controls found that the urinary level of dbp was significantly higher in patients with endometriosis . \\n a study using a rat model of endometriosis reported that treatment with vitamin d3 produced fibrosis and apoptosis in the stroma of tissues with endometriosis . a study on induced endometriosis in adult balb female mice reported that administration of 100 g / kg / day elocalcitol ( a vitamin d receptor agonist ) for 3 weeks reduced total lesion weight . because a relationship between vitamin d and endometriosis has been suggested by multiple studies , and since there has been no randomized clinical trial on endometriosis and vitamin d treatment in women , we decided to explore this relationship . in the present study on endometriosis - related pain \\n , we found no significant difference in results of vitamin d treatment vs. placebo at 24 weeks after surgical diagnosis and treatment . \\n vitamin d is a fat - soluble vitamin mainly produced in the body from food and supplements and cutaneous sun exposure . \\n vitamin d deficiency is defined as serum 1.25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 levels under 20 ng / ml . \\n it is reported in 52% of black and hispanic adolescents in boston and in 48% of girls in maine , and it is seen in 40100% of elderly men and women in the usa and europe . a study in germany found that 57% of people \\n 1879 years old were vitamin d deficient . the prevalence of vitamin d deficiency was reported to be 90% in healthy subjects in delhi , india . in a systematic review of 195 studies in 44 countries found that 37.3% of studies found that the mean serum vitamin d levels were less than 20 ng / ml . \\n the prevalence in pregnant turkish women was 81.4% . in a study of high school students in iran , \\n the serum mean vitamin d level was 14.79.4 ng / ml . in another study in university students in shiraz , iran , 51.2% of female students had low serum levels of vitamin d . because the incidence of vitamin d deficiency in iran is high and we did not check the serum vitamin d levels in samples before intervention , it is possible that this dose and duration of vitamin d prescription was beneficial only for treatment of vitamin d deficiency and not endometriosis . in 1072 women attending an infertility center , \\n an in vitro study compared the effect of vitamin d3 on 25 human endometriosis stromal cell cultures ( ovarian endometrioma ) with the effect of vitamin d3 on culture of 20 endometrial samples of non - endometriosis women ; vitamin d3 inhibited proliferation , invasion , and pro - inflammatory cytokine production in endometriosis and reduced production of interleukin 6 and other inflammatory cytokines that stimulate adhesion of endometrial cells to the peritoneal cavity . a study on in vitro effects of vitamin d3 on human endometriosis stromal cells found that vitamin d3 significantly reduced interleukin 1 and tumor necrotizing factor- inflammatory responses , and also reported fewer endometrial stromal cells and reduced dna synthesis . \\n the study found significantly lower serum vitamin d3 levels in severe endometriosis compared to normal controls and patients with mild endometriosis . a study in italy investigated the effect of vitamin d on primary dysmenorrhea . \\n the samples were 40 women aged 1840 years old with 4 consecutive painful periods in the past 6 months . \\n they measured the serum levels of 25 hydroxy vitamin d with high - performance liquid chromatography . \\n then the women were randomized into a group of 20 women who received a single oral dose of 300 000 iu vitamin d ( cholecalciferol ) at 5 days before their next menstrual cycle and another group of 20 women received placebo . \\n there was a negative correlation between the baseline dysmenorrhea pain score and the level of 25 hydroxy vitamin d3 ( r=0.36 , p=0.2 ) . \\n the researchers found a significant reduction of dysmenorrhea pain in the vitamin d group in comparison with the placebo group in the next 2 menstruations ( p<0.01 ) . \\n they suggested this significant reduction of dysmenorrhea pain in vitamin d prescription group was due to decreased levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines and decreased the biological activity of prostaglandins . \\n the samples were not assessed for existing endometriosis . because low levels of serum vitamin d are common in healthy italian pre - menopausal women , these results only show that vitamin d was effective in relieving dysmenorrhea at least for 2 months after treatment in women with or without endometriosis and also in women with or without vitamin d deficiency . \\n there may be a relationship between vitamin d and pathogenesis of endometriosis , but in our study vitamin d was not effective in treatment of endometriosis - related pain . \\n larger clinical trials are needed to determine the possible effects of vitamin d supplementation in endometriosis treatment . \\n the first limitation of this study is the high prevalence of vitamin d deficiency in our country and worldwide , meaning that a high percentage of our samples may have had vitamin d deficiency , which may have affected the results of our research . \\n further clinical trials are needed on the role of vitamin d treatment for endometriosis - related pain . \\n future studies should assess the serum levels of vitamin d before enrolling study subjects , and those with vitamin d deficiency should be excluded . \\n the first limitation of this study is the high prevalence of vitamin d deficiency in our

therapy , and transient neonatal diabetes mellitus ( tndm ) where the condition shows remission during infancy but relapses in adolescence . \\n almost all cases of neonatal diabetes have monogenic etiology in contrast to the autoimmune diabetes presenting in children beyond 6 months of age . \\n pndm is associated with defects in pancreatic beta cell development and function . activating mutations in the kcnj11 gene , encoding the subunit kir6.2 , and abcc8 gene , \\n encoding the sulfonylurea receptor 1 ( sur1 ) of atp - sensitive potassium ( katp ) channel , which has a key role in insulin secretion in glucose metabolism , are the most common causes and account for approximately 40% of all cases of pndm12 ) . \\n mutations in the glucokinase ( gck ) and insulin ( ins ) genes have also been reported in patients with pndm . \\n sulfonylureas close the katp channel by an atp - independent route , leading to increase insulin secretion4 ) . \\n therefore , in many patients with pndm with kir6.2 and sur1 mutations , insulin therapy can be replaced by oral sulfonylureas which offer more improvement in glycemic control and better quality of life35 ) . \\n we report a case of pndm caused by a novel p.h186d heterozygous mutation in the kcnj11 gene whose treatment was successfully transitioned from insulin to oral sulfonylurea . \\n her parents were unrelated , and her family was healthy and had no history of diabetes . \\n laboratory results at diagnosis were : blood glucose , 1,041 mg / dl ; ph , 7.025 ; hco3 , 5.1 \\n mmol / l ; pco2 , 19.8 mmhg ; sodium , 147

her maximal daily insulin dose was at 1.5 u / kg . her insulin requirement was gradually decreased to 0.44 u / kg / day by 4 months of age . \\n although there were several hypoglycemic events , insulin injection for glucose control after the infancy period could not be stopped . \\n genetic study for neonatal diabetes using genomic dna extracted from peripheral lymphocyte was done at 4.5 years of age , and a novel heterozygous mutation of the kcnj11 gene located on chromosome 11p15.1 and encoding kir6.2 , c.556c > g ( p.his186asp ) , was found ( fig . \\n transition of treatment from insulin to sulfonylurea was attempted at the age of 4.8 . before the trial , \\n laboratory findings were as follows : hba1c , 6.9% ; fasting glucose , 205 mg / dl ; c - peptide , 0.84 ng / ml ; 24-hour urine c - peptide , 2.2 g ; negative for islet cell antibody ; anti - insulin antibody ; and anti - gad antibody . \\n she was 103.2 cm in height ( 25th-50th percentile ) , 17 kg in weight ( 50th-75th percentile ) and did not have any specific neurological deficit . \\n oral sulfonylurea ( glibenclamide ) was initiated at a dose of 0.1 mg / kg / day divided into two equal doses . \\n the glibenclamide dose was gradually increased to 0.4 mg / kg / day over 1 week and the insulin was stopped . \\n oral glucose tolerance test ( glucose , 1.75 g / kg ) was done at 6 months and 1 year after completion of the sulfonylurea transition . \\n insulinogenic index [ insulin ( 30 min-0 min)/glucose ( 30 min-0 min ) ] , a marker of beta cell function , became increased from 0.10 to 0.18 , and acute c - peptide response [ c - peptide ( 30 min-0 min)1,000/glucose ( 30 min-0 min ) ] became increased from 6.48 to 8.29 ( table 1 ) . \\n the patient is now 7.5 years of age with a height of

kir6.2 and sur1 of katp channel in pancreatic beta cells are the most common and account for nearly half of all cases of pndm12 ) . \\n mutations in the glucokinase ( gck ) , insulin ( ins ) genes have also been reported in patients with pndm . \\n the causes of rare syndromic pndm includes recessive mutations in several genes , such as pdx1 , eif2ak3 , gck , ptf1a , foxp3 , neurog3 , neurod1 , rfx6 , ier3ip1 , hnf1b , glis3 , pax6 , slc19a2 , slc2a2 , and wfs167 ) . in tndm \\n , imprinted locus at chromosome 6q24 seen in more than half of cases8 ) , and kcnj11 and abcc8 gene mutations are also found in some cases . \\n glucose increases intracellular atp level and it induces the closure of katp channels that lead to insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells . activating mutations in the kcnj11 or abcc8 gene of katp channel lead to katp channels remaining open despite the presence of glucose , thus , insulin secretion can not be increased1 ) . on the contrary , loss of function mutations cause congenital hyperinsulinemia due to the closure of the katp channel and lead to increased insulin secretion \\n . sulfonylureas ( su ) can close the katp channel and increase insulin secretion4 ) . \\n treatment response is not expected in patients with mutations in other genes , such as glucokinase gene , foxp3 , and ipf1 . \\n therefore , molecular diagnosis in neonatal diabetes may help identify patients that are likely to respond to oral sulfonylureas . \\n pearson et al.3 ) reported the responses to sulfonylurea according to mutation types in diabetic patients caused by kcnj11 mutation . \\n there were no differences in blood insulin , c - peptide level , and insulin injection dose between the successful group and unsuccessful group . \\n v59 m , r201c , f35v , h46y , r50q , g53r , r201l , e322k , y330s , f333i mutations also belong to the successful group . \\n switching to su was unsuccessful in patients with q52r , i296l , and l164p mutations . \\n in addition , failure of switching to su was more related with the presence of neurologic features ( 14% in successful group and 80% in unsuccessful group ) and older age at initiation of su . \\n median age was 6 years old ( intraquartile range , 3 - 12 years ) in the successful group and 18 years old ( intraquartile range , 6 - 35 years ) in the unsuccessful group3 ) . \\n the report about a mother and daughter carrying the same kcnj11 mutation showed that the daughter could be switched from insulin to su at age 8.5 years , but her mother had an imcomplete response9 ) . \\n the trial of su switching in a poorly controlled diabetic 19 years old patient with r201h mutation , a mutation type expected to respond successfully , failed10 ) . \\n these observations suggest that factors that can affect the success of switching to su include ; mutation type , severity of mutation , and duration of the diabetes . \\n a long - standing diabetes may lead to islet beta cell exhaustion resulting in nonresponse to su9 ) . \\n ndm caused by kcnj11 gene mutations is inherited in autosomal dominant pattern , but most of these cases result from new mutations without family history . the patient in this case has a novel mutation ( p.h186d ) in the kcnj11 gene and presented with a mild form of pndm . \\n switching to su with an initial dose 0.4 mg / kg / day was successful at 4.8 years of age . \\n oral glucose tolerance test in index patient showed improvement in insulin secretion during the treatment at 6 months and 12 months after the use of su . \\n although she had hypoglycemia every 2 or 3 weeks and experienced a few episodes of hypoglycemia with mental change during insulin treatment , there was no more hypoglycemia after changing to su treatment . oral sulfonylurea therapy is both safe and better than insulin for metabolic control . \\n reported side effects of oral su are transitory diarrhea and tooth discoloration in a few patients311 ) . \\n mean hba1c was 8.1% in patients with insulin injection and 6.4% in patients with su therapy312 ) . \\n chronic su treatment seems to develop no beta cell desensitisation in pndm patients with kcnj11 mutation13 ) . \\n early su therapy at disease onset can permit insulin hypersensitivity and maintained basal insulin secretion , then provide long - term remission in animal subset14 ) . allowing for the potential beneficial effect on neurodevelopmental outcome and glycemic control , empiric tiral of su before genetic testing in neonatal diabetes patients can be considered15 ) . in conclusion , as the mutation type , severity of mutation , and duration of the diabetes are the major factors affecting the success of switching to su , early genetic analysis and trial of sulfonylurea is important in the management of neonatal diabetes . \\n further studies looking at the result of su treatment and long term follow in pndm patients are needed .', \"in 2011 , who declared  combat drug resistance : no action today ,

26 xdr strains isolated from different icus , 10 ( 38.5% ) ( the highest number ) \\n the percentage of mdr and xdr strains isolated from different icus was 72/138 ( 52.2% ) and 26/138 ( 18.8% ) , respectively , which were again much more than mdr and xdr strains isolated from wards 321/742 ( 43.3% ) and 120/742 ( 16.2% ) , respectively . \\n 275 patients were admitted to nicu , of whom 29 (

2.1% ) were positive for xdr strains . in micu , \\n 545 patients were admitted and 20 ( 3.7% ) were positive for mdr strains and 8 ( 1.5% ) were positive for xdr strains . \\n the clinical and financial burden to patients and health care providers for mdros is really challenging . \\n barbara soule , joint commission resources practice leader , infection prevention and control services , has told , \\n patients who are infected with mdros often have an increased risk of prolonged illness and mortality . \\n the cost of care for these patients can be more than double as compared to those without mdro infection  . since the year 2000 , only 4 new classes of antibiotics have been approved by food and drug administration ( fda ) , us , for example , linezolid , streptogramins , daptomycin , and tigecycline . \\n the problem is that the bacteria are developing resistance at a much faster pace than the new drug development . regarding public health attention , mdros are described as superbugs having very limited treatment options . for some mdros \\n , only 1 or 2 antibiotics can be effective with toxic side effects . in 2009 , boucher et al . \\n have reported eskape organisms as  bad bugs ,  where e stands for enterococcus faecium , s for staphylococcus aureus , k for klebsiella pneumoniae , a for acinetobacter baumannii , p for pseudomonas aeruginosa , and e for enterobacter species . in the year 2009 only \\n , peterson has reported the escape group of organism , which was the same as the above list but k was replaced by c , that is , clostridium difficile , and the last e stands for enterobacteriaceae . in the present study , amongst 250 gnb - mdr strains isolated , the commonest mdr strains were detected from e. coli 79/250 ( 31.6% ) , followed by klebsiella pneumoniae 75/250 ( 30% ) . \\n similarly , out of 90 gnb - xdr strains isolated , the commonest xdr strains were detected from pseudomonas aeruginosa 29/90 ( 32.2% ) , followed by klebsiella pneumoniae 25/90 ( 27.8% ) . \\n aly and balkhy reported that most prevalent mdro in their study was e. coli followed by klebsiella pneumoniae . in another study , carried out in a tertiary care hospital in riyadh \\n , it has been reported that most frequent mdr pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa followed by e. coli . \\n the percentage of mdr e. coli strains was more than klebsiella pneumoniae and even pseudomonas aeruginosa in our study probably because a total number of e. coli strains isolated ( 261 ) were also higher . \\n the slightly increased incidence of drug resistant strains observed in our study may be because our hospital is a tertiary care center in a rural setup and patients from adjoining districts and even villages are admitted for treatment . before attending the hospital , most of the patients get different antibiotics from general practitioners or due to over - the - counter sell of antibiotics often in improper dose . \\n the limitation of this study is that this is a single center study for only three - month period in a tertiary care hospital in central india . to reflect the trend of infections caused by mdr and xdr strains of bacteria in the region , a multicenter study involving all types of healthcare setups for a minimum period of one year \\n there is paucity of data regarding mdros in health care setup not only in india but also worldwide . \\n unless and until multidrug resistant organisms are detected and their incidence is known , the strategies for their control can not be adopted properly in healthcare setup . hence , detection , prevention of transmission of mdros by following infection control practices , antimicrobial surveillance , and stewardship are need of the hour . \\n misuse and overuse of antibiotics , over - the - counter selling of antibiotics without prescription to common people , must be stopped by strict implementations of rules and regulations . \\n we hereby conclude that early detection and close monitoring of mdr , xdr , or even pdr bacterial strains must be started by all clinical microbiology laboratories to reduce the menace of antimicrobial resistance which is now a global problem .\", \"ureterocele is a congenital urinary abnormality characterized by the presence of an intrabladder hernia or cystic ballooning of the lower end of a ureter lying between the mucosa and muscle of the bladder . \\n the abnormality leads to urinary retention and recurrent urinary tract infection ( uti ) , which can cause irreversible damage to the kidney . \\n this abnormality can be suspected in the fetus by antenatal ultrasonography ( usg ) and confirmed by other x - ray investigations after birth . \\n the incidence of ureterocele is variable with the highest rate of 1:500 and it is generally found in females with duplex system association ( 95% ) . \\n ureteroceles can have different clinical presentations , such as antenatal hydronephrosis , uti , vesicoureteral reflux ( vur ) , bladder outlet obstruction , prolapsed urethral mass , etc . \\n usg and voiding cystourethrography ( vcug ) are essential initial procedures for a child suspected of having a ureteral anomaly . \\n a 5-year - old female child was referred to our department for tc - diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid ( dtpa ) scan . \\n she was a follow - up case of right - sided hydroureteronephrosis with pyonephrosis with percutaneous tube ( pcn ) insertion done on the right side . \\n patient 's blood urea and serum creatinine were 29 and 1.3 mg / dl , respectively . \\n usg of the abdomen revealed left - sided mild hydroureteronephrosis and gross enlargement of the right kidney , reaching up to lower abdomen with dilated pelvis and ureter . \\n the child was referred for evaluation of glomerular filtration rate and excretory function of kidneys . \\n tc - dtpa scan was done in our department with right pcn tube in situ . \\n pcn tube was clamped during the acquisition of dynamic and prevoid static image and clamp released thereafter . on tc - dtpa scan , left kidney showed good perfusion and adequate cortical radiotracer concentration followed by good drainage into dilated ureter . \\n right ureter and right pelvicalyceal system ( pcs ) were visualized in the postvoid image ( indirect evidence of vur ) [ figure 2b , thin arrow ] . \\n retention of radiotracer was noted in dilated pcs and dilated ureter in delayed static images acquired till 4 h [ figure 2c and d ] . \\n faint visualization of radiotracer was noted through the pcn tube after removal of clamp [ figure 2b , bold arrow ] . \\n a large photopenia was noted in the suprapubic region in the urinary bladder ( ub ) during dynamic [ figure 1 ] as well as delayed static images acquired till 4 h [ figure 2a  d ] . \\n an usg of the abdomen was done in the radiology department of our hospital to find out the cause of this persistent photopenia in the ub . \\n usg of the abdomen showed evidence of left - sided mild hydroureteronephrosis and grossly enlarged hydronephrotic right kidney with dilated right ureter and an intracystic ureterocele arising from the right side [ figure 3a and b ] . \\n perfusion and dynamic images of 99mtc - diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid scan scintigraphy , posterior view with percutaneous clamp in situ , showing good perfusion and

photopenia in the urinary bladder ( arrow marked ) ( a and b ) ultrasonography images depicting right ureterocele within the urinary bladder ( ub ) and dilated distal right ureter \\n according to literature , 90% of the patients with ureterocele are diagnosed before the age of 3 years . \\n most of the patients with ureterocele are classically diagnosed during the investigation for uti , asymptomatic hydronephrosis , and abdominal mass . \\n although the age of diagnosis is decreasing , uti is still the most common clinical presentation of ureterocele in 50% of the patients promoting physician to make the thorough evaluation of the urinary system . \\n the whole nephronourinary system could have already been negatively affected at the time of diagnosis . in our case , \\n usg is an easy method to perform , noninvasive , and probably the best imaging modality for making the diagnosis . \\n reflux can occur in the ipsilateral lower pole in almost half of the patients , but the contralateral system is also affected at a rate of 25% . the tc - dimercapto succinic acid ( dmsa ) scan should be undertaken routinely to assess the distribution of function in the duplex kidney and for detecting and follow - up of scarred tissue and nonfunctioning upper poles in cases of ureterocele . \\n did a study on pediatric ureteroceles in 19 patients , on the diagnosis , management and treatment options . \\n vcug was able to detect vur in 13 out of 17 patients ( 33% ) . \\n dmsa scintigraphy showed ipsilateral renal scarring and nonfunctioning upper pole images in 7 out of 13 patients . computed tomography and mag3 scintigraphy \\n did a study on the management of 36 patients with varied presentation of complicated ureteroceles . \\n usg , micturating cystourethrogram , isotope renogram were done preoperatively in all the babies . in one of the cases , \\n initial usg was unable to detect ureterocele in most of the cases in this study . \\n they said that unless the usg is done in well - hydrated , cooperative patient , ureterocele is likely to be missed on usg . \\n hence , an intravenous pyelogram , radioisotope renogram , and micturating cystourethrogram are invaluable in the complete understanding of ureterocele . in our patient also , the diagnosis of ureterocele was missed on initial usg . \\n photopenia was noted in the ub on our scan , and this prompted us to investigate the patient further . \\n possible causes for photopenic defects in the ub on nuclear scintigraphic studies include bladder papilloma , bladder polyp , carcinoma bladder , bladder calculus , foreign body in ub , intravesical ureterocele , etc . \\n repeat usg revealed the cause of photopenia in ub in our case to be an intravesical ureterocele . on reviewing the literature we found that tc - dtpa scan is useful in the evaluation of renal function in patient with known ureteroceles . \\n however , in our case on finding the photopenia in the ub on tc - dtpa scan , intravesical ureterocele was detected on usg . \\n  \\n \", 'the majority of women with menorrhagia , postcoital bleeding , intermenstrual bleeding , or postmenopausal bleeding ultimately undergo diagnostic hysteroscopy with endometrial sampling as part of their assessment , particularly if symptoms persist or pelvic imaging suggests a uterine abnormality . \\n dilatation and curettage ( d&c ) has been widely considered to be the method of choice for obtaining endometrial samples for histopathological evaluation \\n . however , the needs for admission and general anesthesia and their associated costs have made this option less favorable . in the outpatient setting , endometrial sampling is an effective and acceptable method for obtaining endometrial samples for histopathological assessment [ 3 , 4 ] . \\n inadequate sampling is more problematic in postmenopausal women , for whom up to 68% of endometrial samples are reported to be inadequate . in our institution , the only sampling tool available to perform the outpatient sampling procedure is the uterine explora model i - mx120 ( http://www.coopersurgical.com/ ) ( figure 1 ) . \\n in addition , the device is sterile and disposable ( one - time use ) . \\n the advantages of using explora rather than d&c as a sampling device include a reduction in hospitalization costs , extra convenience for the patient and physician , and the minimal complications of the procedure . \\n the purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the explora model i tool with the conventional d&c technique for obtaining adequate endometrial samples that are capable of providing specific and informative histopathologic diagnoses . \\n after obtaining the approval of our institutional review board , all endometrial samples received at the histopathology department in king khalid university hospital ( kkuh , riyadh , ksa ) between january 2007 and december 2010 were included in this study . a total of 1270 endometrial samples were included ( table 1 ) . \\n two hundred seventy - four samples ( 21.6% ) were obtained by conventional d&c in the surgical theater , while the remaining 996 samples ( 78.4% ) were obtained by senior obstetrics and gynecology residents who used a standardized biopsy technique in the outpatient procedure rooms . during the usage of the explora model \\n i , the syringe provided with the instrument was used to create a negative pressure , and the explora was rotated as it was withdrawn . after withdrawal , the tip was cut off , and the tissue was placed in 10% buffered formalin saline fixative and was sent for pathological examination . \\n the pathologists who interpreted the endometrial samples were blinded to the instrument or method used to obtain the samples . \\n an inadequate sample was defined as consisting of only blood , cervical mucus , endocervical epithelium , or blood with fragments of endometrial glands or stroma insufficient for histopathological assessment and diagnosis . \\n the age , gravidity , parity , menstrual history , uterine size , hysteroscopy findings ( when available ) , and the presence or absence of any cervical abnormality were recorded on the request forms , which were reviewed by the investigators . for each of the two methods used ( explora model i and d&c ) , the numbers and percentages of inadequate samples and age group clustering were calculated and statistically analyzed . \\n of the 1270 endometrial samples obtained , 253 samples ( 19.9% ) were scored as inadequate . of these samples , \\n the explora sampler was used to collect 224 samples ( 88.5% ) , whereas 29 samples ( 11.5% ) were obtained by d&c ( figure 2 ) . \\n thus , the insufficient tissue percentage was higher with the explora ( 17.6% ) than with d&c ( 2.2% ) , which was a statistically significant difference ( p < 0.0001 ) \\n . age group clustering ( i.e. , numbers of premenopausal and postmenopausal women ) of inadequate sample results was also calculated ( figure 3 ) . of the 253 inadequate samples , \\n 82.6% were from women 45 years of age and older ( i.e. , postmenopausal ) compared to 17.4% in premenopausal women ; the age difference was significant ( p < 0.0001 ) . \\n the detection rates of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma using both methods were assessed and calculated . \\n of the 73 samples with a diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia , 50 ( 68.5% ) were diagnosed by d&c , and 23 ( 31.5% ) were diagnosed using the explora sampler . \\n however , of the 18 samples with a diagnosis of endometrial cancer , the rates of detection were similar between the two methods . \\n endometrial sampling for the evaluation of dysfunctional uterine bleeding and the diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma and other indications remains one of the most commonly performed gynecological procedures [ 14 ] . in recent years \\n , less hazardous and more inexpensive and convenient outpatient sampling methods have replaced the traditional , in - hospital , endometrial curettage . \\n the advantages of outpatient endometrial biopsy include reduced cost and less risk for the patient , as no anesthesia is required . \\n furthermore , the discomfort and pain produced by sampling have been reported to be minimal . \\n however , it is essential to ensure that outpatient endometrial sampling is quantitatively adequate and comparably accurate to conventional dilatation and curettage . \\n a sample is judged as adequate if a specific diagnosis can be given from the histological examination of the endometrial fragments obtained . \\n adequacy can be measured by comparison of either outpatient biopsy with curettage histological evaluation or outpatient biopsy with the results of pathological examination of hysterectomy specimens [ 3 , 4 ] . \\n many techniques for obtaining an endometrial sample without the need for curettage have been described in the literature . \\n chicago , il , usa ) and the novak biopsy curette with a 10  ml syringe functioning as an aspiratory device , which have been shown to be equally effective compared to d&c in detecting an endometrial pathology [ 69 ] . \\n however , the vabra aspirator and novak biopsy curette , although widely available and relatively inexpensive , have several disadvantages , including the need for an electric vacuum pump to perform the aspiration in the former technique and the pain caused by both methods . as a result of these drawbacks , smaller inexpensive and \\n self - contained instruments have been developed and the prototype of this class of endometrial samplers is the pipelle . the pipelle has been shown to have a diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of vabra aspiration and the novak curettage while causing less pain [ 911 ] . \\n all of these instruments ( i.e. , the vabra aspirator , the novak biopsy curette , and the pipelle ) have low rates of false - negative and insufficient tissue results for the detection of endometrial abnormalities , as determined by comparison to hysterectomy specimens [ 1113 ] . \\n it was found that pipelle biopsy had a sensitivity of 99.2% in pinpointing high grade cancer and a sensitivity of 93% in detecting low grade malignancies ; the sensitivities defined for d&c were 100% and 97% , respectively . while \\n excellent agreement  was generally noted between preoperative histology and grade and the final pathology , pre - operative endometrial sampling more commonly provided underestimates of final grade ( low grade versus high grade ) than overestimates . \\n the explora is somewhat similar in its design to the pipelle , but clinical studies on its effectiveness are scarce , with the effectiveness ranging between 14.6 and 15% according to various studies [ 6 , 15 ] . \\n our own findings revealed that the rate of obtaining inadequate samples using the explora was much higher ( 17.6% ) than the rates reported in the literature . \\n however , most of these cases ( 82.6% ) were obtained from postmenopausal women with atrophic endometrial status . \\n this finding is in keeping with the rates reported by other investigators [ 58 , 16 ] . \\n this retrospective study suggests that traditional d&c produces better endometrial sample adequacy than the explora technique . \\n this finding indicates that clinicians performing endometrial sampling would benefit from more experience and training using the explora technique . \\n additional studies comparing the adequacy of samples obtained with different endometrial sampling techniques and devices are warranted . \\n furthermore , we recommend using the d&c procedure when the explora - obtained samples are inconclusive or when the use of the explora sampler is accompanied by ultrasound findings that are suspicious of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma .', \"with increasing availability , widened indications , and technical refinements of computed tomography ( ct ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , the number of incidentally discovered adrenal lesions , such as adrenal incidentalomas and incidental adrenal enlargement , is increasing . in a recent study by tang et al . \\n , among a total of 564 eligible ct studies ( patients undergoing ct without prior known malignancy , trauma , or endocrine disease ) , adrenal hyperplasia was detected in 64 cases , giving a prevalence of 11.3% . \\n this indicated that incidental adrenal enlargement had a significant prevalence and has become a common clinical problem . \\n it should be emphasized that the term incidental adrenal enlargement represents the way the lesion was detected ( incidentally ) , rather than the etiology or diagnosis . \\n it is a common term for a variety of adrenal disorders , but its cause must be properly assessed so that patients needing treatment , such as those with hormone hypersecretion or malignant disease , can receive appropriate care . however , there is a lack of literature on functional status and its follow - up to provide comprehensive insight to these findings . \\n patients with incidental adrenal enlargement were evaluated in a tertiary referral hospital with endocrinological departments in china . \\n this study aimed to determine the primary clinical presentation that most frequently leads to the discovery of adrenal enlargement , to evaluate clinical characteristics and functional status of these patients , and to analyze risk factors for functional lesions . \\n this retrospective study included 578 patients with adrenal imaging features showing adrenal enlargement who were hospitalized at the department of endocrinology in pla general hospital ( beijing , china ) between january 1993 and july 2013 . \\n data retrieved included patient demographics , final functional diagnosis , adrenal imaging features , and concomitant diseases . \\n patients were classified as having incidental adrenal enlargement when abdominal imaging was performed for indications unrelated to adrenal disease . \\n patients with diseases known to cause adrenal enlargement , such as known endocrine disorders which could affect adrenal size , trauma , and underlying malignancy , were excluded . among all enrolled patients , 78 presented with incidental adrenal enlargement . \\n the ct imaging technique used was not standardized due to the various clinical indications . however , to be included in their entirety on a maximum of 5  mm section thickness , the upper limit of normal was set as 10  mm for the body of the gland and 5  mm for each limb as documented by vincent et al . . \\n the type of enlargement , based on subjective evaluation of the adrenal glands , was recorded as either smooth or nodular . \\n nodular enlargement was diagnosed if the adrenal gland had an irregular contour , contained nodules , and had normal adrenal tissue interspersed between the nodules . \\n smooth enlargement was defined as enlargement of the gland with a smooth contour and no measureable or diffuse nodules . after obtaining patient history and physical examination , all patients underwent biochemical evaluation to assess their functional status . \\n patients with elevated 24-hour urine - free cortisol level ( 2 times ) or those in whom plasma cortisol levels did not decrease after an overnight low - dose dexamethasone test ( 1  mg dst ; cutoff 50 \\n patients with an aldosterone - rennin ratio ( arr ) > 20 underwent any 1 of 3 confirmatory tests ( saline infusion , captopril challenge , or postural stimulation ) to confirm or exclude definitively primary hyperaldosteronism ( pa ) . \\n categorical data such as gender and clinical / radiologic features were compared using -test or fisher 's exact test . \\n variables that resulted in a p < 0.05 in the univariate analyses were entered into logistic regression analysis to assess the risk factors of functional lesions . \\n the hospital ethics committee approved this study , and written informed consent was obtained from all patients or their parents . \\n of 578 patients with adrenal enlargement , 78 cases ( 13.49% ) were detected incidentally . \\n every 2 years , the numbers of total cases were 17 , 11 , 14 , 24 , 33 , 31 , 54 , 55 , 114 , and 225 , respectively . \\n the numbers of incidental adrenal enlargement cases were 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 4 , 16 , and 49 , respectively . \\n in addition , the proportion of incidental adrenal enlargement gradually increased ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 4.17% , 3.03% , 7.32% , 9.26% , 7.27% , 14.04% , and 21.33% ) . \\n 39 cases had unilateral enlargement on the left side and 3 on the right side , and the remaining 36 were bilateral enlargement . \\n as shown in table 1 , routine medical checkup was found to have the greatest chance ( 43.59% ) of revealing clinical onsets leading to the discovery of adrenal enlargement . \\n predominant complaints included low back pain ( 10.26% ) and abdominal pain ( 3.85% ) . in addition , there were 30 ( 38.46% ) cases in which the lesions were incidentally detected during hospitalization for underlying diseases , such as diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and coronary heart disease , among others . biochemical and functional evaluation revealed that 54 ( 69.23% ) cases were nonfunctional and 12 ( 15.38% ) were subclinical cushing syndrome ( scs ) ; among these patients , 10 cases were diagnosed as aimah , the other 2 were diagnosed as adenomas , and they were all confirmed by pathology results . \\n primary hyperaldosteronism 6 ( 7.69% ) , metastatic 1 ( 1.28% ) , the primary cancer was gastric cancer . \\n there were 5 patients ( 6.41% ) whose functional status remained unclear because of failure to finish the functional evaluation ( figure 2 ) . \\n nodular adrenal enlargement ( or 7.306 ; 95% ci , 1.72728.667 ; p = 0.006 ) was the risk factor for functional lesions . \\n as outlined above , incidental adrenal enlargement is detected with increasing frequency , most likely due to widespread increase in cross - sectional imaging , and is gradually emerging as a common clinical problem . \\n our study shows that the proportion of incidental adrenal enlargement has gradually increased by year . \\n mean age at diagnosis was 50.32 years , which is in line with other incidentally detected adrenal findings , namely , adrenal incidentaloma . \\n the increasing age of the general population and a research trend towards more advanced investigations in the elderly population may be contributing to the high detection rate in this age group . \\n our results indicate that , for the elderly patients , it is essential to place emphasis on these incidental findings . \\n 's study   indicated that , of the total 64 patients , of which 40 ( 63% ) were men and 24 ( 37% ) were women , 43 ( 67% ) cases were bilateral enlargement and 21 ( 33% ) cases were unilateral . \\n in addition , smooth enlargement was more common , in 53 ( 83% ) cases , and together these statistics reflect the likelihood that adrenal enlargement will be bilateral , smooth , and found in men . \\n however , our study did not show this tendency , likely because the research goals and thus , study populations , differed between the 2 studies . \\n 's study aimed to explore prevalence , while the present study aimed to evaluate functional status . \\n in addition , patients enrolled in our study were hospitalized at the department of endocrinology . it should be noted that admitting was more or less selective , especially in tertiary referral hospitals , and that economic considerations in parts of china were still a problem . \\n clinically , upon discovery of incidental adrenal enlargement , 2 issues arise : functionality and malignancy . in the relevant literature [ 48 ] , adrenal enlargement can result from endocrine disorders , such as adrenocorticotropic hormone- ( acth- ) dependent or independent cushing syndrome , pa , multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ( men-1 ) , and congenital adrenal hyperplasia . \\n other potential causes include nonfunctional lesions , defined as a radiographic adrenal enlargement without clinical or biochemical manifestations , inflammation , neoplastic processes , obesity , or depression . \\n 12 patients were found to have subclinical cushing syndrome ( originated from the adrenal gland ) and 6 patients were diagnosed with pa . however , the variety of disease spectrum in the study was only moderate , perhaps due , in part , to the limited number of included cases . \\n it is important to note that even though reported prevalence was up to 11.3% , patient referrals to endocrinologists are relatively rare . \\n this is likely related to the poor radiological awareness of this issue and its potential clinical significance . \\n the clinical significance of lesion location and patient gender is smaller . in the present study , \\n acth - independent macronodular hyperplasia ( aimah ) and primary pigmented nodular adrenal hyperplasia often manifest as adrenal hyperplasia . the clinical features of aimah tended to be atypical . \\n nodules usually distorted and completely obscured the normal adrenal glands and were characteristically  ginger - like  . \\n as for pa , adrenal glands affected by idiopathic hyperaldosteronism ( iha ) may be normal on the ct scan or show nodular changes , and small aldosterone producing adenoma ( apas ) may be interpreted incorrectly by the radiologists as \\n iha  on the basis of ct findings of bilateral nodularity or normal - appearing adrenal glands [ 1013 ] . \\n thus , it is a simple matter to explain why nodular enlargement could be a predictive factor of functional lesions . \\n meanwhile , this also suggests that if incidentally detected lesions were nodular enlargements , evaluating its functional status should be a priority . \\n in addition , the present study suggests that lesions on the left side were likely to be nonfunctional . \\n in addition , there was only one patient with malignant lesion in the present study , and thus we were unable to analyze incidence of malignancy . \\n incidental adrenal enlargement is a frequent radiographic finding and it is accompanied by diverse clinical factors that require proper diagnostic evaluation and management . in functional evaluation ,\", \"pursuing the goal of improved health literacy requires more alliances between health and education sectors to improve literacy levels in the population . \\n it is important for health educators to know about knowledge transfer to meet their needs in transferring their knowledge to public \\n . knowledge transfer , which means the synthesis , exchange and ethically application of knowledge within a complex system of relationship among researchers and users , has become one of the recent priorities in research centers . the word \\n the method of knowledge transfer , apart from its characteristics , requires active interactions between researchers and users . \\n caplan proposes the two- communities theory indicating a gap between researchers and policymakers , whereas these days another gap has been formed between researchers and other users . \\n in addition to illiteracy in developing countries that hampers effective health education , there are multitudes of non - medical specialists who do not have enough information about daily health affairs , and this lack is more remarkable in countries that welcome immigrants . \\n immigrants often have significant language and health literacy difficulties , which are further exacerbated by cultural barriers . \\n alongside with sophisticated methods like computer and internet , using simple methods help us bring to achieve our health goals[68 ] . also , the lack of health literacy needs more attention when it is manifested in caregivers . \\n it is believed that some of the undesirable health outcomes in children are because of inadequate health knowledge among caregivers . in the usa , \\n therefore researchers have considered different methods to come up with this deficiency by having children to cooperate in their health programs . \\n a research group in india endeavored to transfer knowledge on leprosy in cooperation with children and informed their parents through them . \\n jacob et al ( 1994 ) started conducting a similar research that yields promising results . \\n rimal and flora ( 1998 ) express that parental dietary behavior is partially affected by children . \\n the findings from studies in this field have encouraged other experts to apply similar methods to conduct their research projects , allahverdipour and bashirian , onyango - ouma and mwangagain from the influence of children in order to teach different parts of their society[1316 ] . despite the researcher 's trends in using novel methods in this field , \\n none of them have used childish poem as a medium for knowledge transferring . in this study \\n , we try to raise families health knowledge about infectious diseases by a method that uses children as health agents . \\n infectious diseases are still the leading cause of mortality in children less than 60 months in developing countries . \\n juvenile age is accompanied by learning childish poems , which can be sung contnuously at home and potentially become as part of both children 's and parents memories . \\n we decided to transfer health knowledge to families through altering this information to childish poems and teaching children at kindergartens . in this method \\n the outcome of transferring health knowledge through childish poems has been assessed in this study . \\n in this study , we use the method of interventional pre and post series to conduct our research . \\n the proposal of this non - invasive project was approved by the research committee of hamadan medical university in january 2009 . \\n it was also accepted by hamadan welfare organization , which is the responsible organization of kindergartens in hamadan . \\n our methodology is briefly explained as follows . at first , a sub specialist in pediatric infectious diseases provides seven short texts about health and common pediatric infectious diseases prevention . \\n then , a poet transfers these conceptions to childish poems for the first time ( appendix 1&2 ) . in the process of preparing an accurate questionnaire , at first 30 questions with three choices of \\n ,  false  and  do not know  were made , but 24 items of those are confirmed as valid questions by two experts of health education and infectious diseases . to assess \\n the reliability of the questionnaire a pilot study on a 40 participant sample was performed and cronbach 's alpha of the questionnaire was determined as 83 percent . \\n in addition , we defined knowledge mark ( km ) as a parent mark in both the pre - test and/or post - tests . among 35 kindergartens in hamadan , we selected 7 kindergartens by simple random method . \\n the parents ( either father or mother , the one who is responsible to take her / his child ) of all five to six year old children of the selected kindergartens are asked to participate in the survey and a verbal consent is obtained from those who accepted . \\n we excluded the following children from our sample : those whose parents are physicians , nurses , health - care workers , and those children whose parents work at the kindergarten ( exclusion criteria ) . \\n we asked the parents of the sample survey to participate in a pretest by answering to a questionnaire when they are in the kindergartens . \\n also , they were asked to come to the kindergartens personally one more time when it is required ( to answer to the post test ) . then , we asked our kindergarten tutors to teach children seven musical poems about hydatid cyst , antibiotic misuse , botulinum toxin in home - canned foods , dysentery , the importance of sixth tooth , brucellosis and tetanus . in this step , children were not allowed to take home these texts , but they were asked to sing the poems at home and want their parents to re - write the poems on a paper and give them the papers to take to the kindergarten . \\n the teaching stage took between three to four months . during the next stage , parents took a post - test survey with the same 24 questions . \\n parents of 115 kids participated in the pre - test and 103 of them completed the post - test . \\n statistical analysis is done on 103 who completed both tests by paired t - test . \\n the sample data consists of 103 parents who provided solutions to both the pre- and post - test question survey . of the participants 77 were female and 26 male . from the level of education point of view \\n , 19 were below high school diploma , 45 had high school diploma , 8 had associate degree , 27 had ba , 3 had ma , and 1 had phd . \\n the results of the survey show a significant difference between the correct answers in both pre - test and post - test stages ( fig . \\n 1 ) . the frequency of correct answers to the tests \\n table 1 shows the mean of the correct answers in the pre - test stage is 59.22 while the same figure for the post - test step is 81 ( p < 0.001 ) . \\n in addition , we define knowledge mark ( km ) as a parent mark in both the pre - test and/or post - test stages . the mean km shows a significant increase ( 5.01 ) from 13.62 in the pre - test to 18.63 in the post - test ( table 2 ) . \\n mean percent of correct answers to pre - test and post - test categories \\n  analyzed by paired t - test sd : standard deviation mean of knowledge mark in pre - test and post test analysed by paired t - test the difference of km promotion among females and males was not significant ( 21.6120.17 in males and 20.331.61 in females , p=0.8 ) . the km was increased to 19.9325.06 among parents who at most had high school diploma and 23.4720.84 among parents with upper educational levels ( p=0.5 ) . \\n health has been the concern of poets such as fiona sampson for years , however , these poems never had educational purposes . the results of this study \\n confirm our hypothesis about the role of children in raising family 's knowledge on health . \\n the results show that neither gender nor the grade of knowledge degree ( below and upper high school diploma or below and upper ba ) affect answers . \\n therefore , people with different educational status have received the information similarly implying that this method can be extended to general cases in a straightforward manner . \\n 1 shows that the percentage of correct answers has increased in 23 out of 24 questions . \\n the percent - age of correct answer to post - test has decreased only in one item ( item 11 ) which compares the risk of brucellosis transmission via unpasteurized milk and yogurt . although the term yogurt has not been mentioned directly in the related poem , but there is a hint about boiling mechanism and we expect that the audience discover the answer by logical thinking about the necessitation of boiling milk for preparing yogurt . \\n the decrease in answering is 2 percent which is not significant ; however , it shows that it would be better to mention the conceptions directly in these types of poems in order to avoid any misconceptions . \\n moreover , the percentage of correct answers to the questions of selected topics in pre - test and post - test has been compared ( table 1 ) and shows that parents have done better in post - test about all topics except one . \\n the difference of correct answers to the questions about brucellosis does not show a significant increase in post - test . \\n this finding is probably due to higher basic knowledge about brucellosis among parents . in other words , parents have had acceptable information about brucellosis even without our educational program , so we observe lower contrast between pre - test and post - test about brucellosis \\n . it should be taken into consideration that brucellosis is an endemic disease in hamadan and people have been educated in different ways about this disease in recent years . although the lowest contrast between pre - test and post - test correct answers belongs to a question about botulism , the overall assessment shows that parent 's knowledge about this topic has been promoted significantly ( p<0.001 , table 1 ) . the significant difference between the pre - test and post - test km , based on the results of table 2 , is the sign of successful knowledge transfer through childish poems . \\n the researcher 's method is impressively successful ; however , the fact that he mentions that some mothers can not distinguish the semantic difference between information and advice , needs serious attention . \\n in addition , since daughters may misunderstand the information , it would be probable to transfer the misconceived information to their mothers and this fact threats the successfulness of study in applying . while , in our study ; firstly , childish poems do not imply sententious , secondly , if the poem is sung wrong , the disturbance in rhythm will be appeared , so the information which is transferred through poems is not at risk of alteration . in evans research , \\n parents get familiar with educated topics with the help of their children in homework assignments designed for asthma management , and are taught about asthma indirectly . \\n the advantage of our study in comparison with evans is that in evans method knowledge transfer brings to bear via homework assignment , while in our study there is no obligation for doing home works , and parents are educated while enjoying their child 's singing . on account of the fact that making communication with younger children is not as difficult as with adolescents for parents , we are sure that knowledge transfers within a family through a continuous and friendly communication will work . \\n christensen expressed the importance of children 's role in promoting the family health status . in his article , he emphasized on the activities that children can perform to enhance their health and promote their family health situation via the health efforts for themselves . \\n we showed that children , additionally to what christensen mentioned , are able to affect their family 's health status directly . they can improve their family 's health as little teachers in health . \\n it should be taken into consideration that the limitations of this study was the impact of other media on participant 's knowledge , which was not preventable . \\n one of the acceptable results of this survey was publishing the poems as a book for children which was republished and welcomed by public . \\n this study 's results suggest that health knowledge transfer to families through childish poems is an applicable method that has many advantages . by applying this joyful , cost - effective and easy - to - use method \\n however , it should be taken into consideration that this method is applicable for families with trainable children , for teaching in larger scales more general ways should be added to this method . \\n moreover , the simplicity of poems and expressing the topics in a less elaborative form are the key factors that affect the successfulness of this way . \\n \", 'septic arthritis of the shoulder is uncommon in adults . it is a surgical emergency as joint destruction occurs rapidly and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality . \\n a 43 years old male came to our outpatient department with complaints of pain and stiffness of his left shoulder . on examination , his shoulder movements were severely restricted . \\n further evaluation with mri revealed septic arthritis of left gleno - humeral joint for which emergency arthroscopic debridement was done . \\n septic arthritis of shoulder may not present with classical clinical features . hence , a through clinical and radiological evaluation will help us prognosticate and treat accordingly thereby preventing complications like septic shock , osteomyelitis . \\n patients with septic arthritis usually develop moderate to severe joint pain , warmth , tenderness , effusion , restricted active and passive motion , and sometimes redness . \\n we report an unusual presentation of shoulder septic arthritis in a 43 years old man with no other clinical signs and symptoms of classical septic arthritis . \\n a 43-year - old man presented to the orthopaedic outpatient clinic with 2 months history of pain and limited range of motion in his left shoulder . \\n his pain was insidious in onset , mild to moderate in intensity , aggravated by activities and associated with moderate rest and night pain . \\n patient was diagnosed as frozen shoulder at an outside facility and had been given intraarticular depomedrol 40 mg injection for the same 40 days ago with no improvement in his symptoms . \\n he is diabetic and has liver cirrhosis and is on treatment . on physical examination , \\n the skin colour and temperature of the left shoulder were normal , but the shoulder was tender to touch over the anterior joint line . \\n mri was obtained [ fig 2 ] which showed extraosseous soft tissue enhancements around left shoulder with soft tissue abscess in inter muscular planes of supraspinatous , infraspinatous , subscapularis . \\n blood test revealed normal white cell count with normal differential count , crp-13.4 mg / l ( normal<5.0 mg \\n the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was raised , at 88 mm / hour ( normal range , 0 - 20 mm / hour ) aspiration of shoulder joint was performed and fluid was sent for aerobic and anaerobic culture , afb staining , mycobacterium culture , and mycobacterium genetic testing . \\n arthroscopic lavage of the joint was done and articular fluid sent for repeat aerobic and anaerobic culture . \\n joint visualization was markedly limited because of severe inflammation and fibrinous changes of the joint . \\n the articular cartilages of glenoid and humeral head were completely eroded down to the bone . \\n susceptibility of the isolate was determined with the disk diffusion method and it was susceptible only to colistin . \\n 3 ) fibrocollagenous and fibrovascular inflammed connective tissue containing proliferated blood vessels and perivascular mixed inflammatory cells and lymphoplasmacytoid cells . \\n based on preoperative and intraoperative culture report , a definitive diagnosis of polymicrobial septic arthritis of the shoulder was established and patient was treated with combination antimicrobial treatment . \\n our patient had muted inflammatory response probably due to immunocompromised state ( cirrhosis and diabetes ) which is not uncommon . \\n most often it is hematogenous seeding of shoulder joint , however it can also happen after intraarticular steroid injections . \\n septic arthritis of the shoulder is more common in immunocompromised patients and intravenous drug abusers . in this case report , the patient had atypical clinical symptoms and is immunocompromised and his primary source of infection seems to be hematogenous . \\n our experience with this patient highlights the importance of maintaining high index of suspicion for septic arthritis in immunocompromised patients presenting with atypical shoulder pain associated with stiffness . in the setting of suspected septic arthritis , \\n our initial pre - investigation diagnosis was atypical shoulder pain and stiffness of non specific etiology in an immunocompromised patient and infection was part of the differential diagnosis not the only diagnosis . \\n esenwein et al in his report highlighted the importance of early intervention to prevent chondral damage , osteomyelitis and also to prevent systemic spread . \\n various authors have highlighted the importance of early diagnosis and management of septic arthritis failing which could lead to osteomyelitis and septic shock . in our patient \\n , the diagnosis was delayed due to atypical presentation and over reliance on clinical findings at an outside center . \\n we strongly recommend early imaging studies in immunocompromised patients presenting with shoulder pain and practitioners should avoid loosely diagnosing as shoulder pain with associated stiffness as frozen shoulders . \\n klinger et al . did a retrospective study on 21 patients who underwent surgical treatment for septic arthritis of the shoulder joint between 2000 and 2007 , and he concluded that patients with symptoms for less than 2 weeks did well with arthroscopic approach and early infection can be managed arthroscopically . \\n our reports show that arthroscopic washout can give good result even after 2 weeks of clinical symptoms if there is no evidence of osteomyelitis . \\n septic arthritis of the shoulder is very often due to hematogenous spread and diagnosis is often clinical . \\n laboratory investigations and imaging studies like mri and usg may be useful in establishing the diagnosis but confirmation is usually by joint aspiration . \\n patients who are immunocompromised and have insidious onset of moderate to severe pain and which fails to respond to trial of conservative treatment should be subjected to either ultrasound or mri instead of x - ray because very often in these group of patients it is primarily a soft tissue pathology like impingement , rc tear , calcific tendinitis or rarely infections and malignancies . \\n we recommend that moderate pain of more than 4 weeks duration with severe stiffness in immunocompromised patient ( liver cirrhosis , renal failure , steroid treatment ) should be further evaluated with mri or ultrasound in the setting of normal x - ray and should not be loosely diagnosed as frozen shoulder . \\n goldenberg in his report emphasized the role of local as well as systemic factors that predispose patients with cirrhosis to gram - negative bacterial joint infections . \\n malnick also reported a case of spontaneous septic arthritis in a cirhottic patient that was due to e.coli . \\n our study as well as other studies by goldenberg and malnick highlight the importance of including broad spectrum antibiotics with gram negative cover whilst waiting for final culture sensitivity . \\n septic arthritis of shoulder may not present with classic clinical features . a through clinical and radiological evaluation should be executed and treatment initiated promptly to prevent complications like septic shock and osteomyelitis . \\n the case highlights the importance of establishing anatomical and pathological diagnosis using mri in patients with shoulder pain instead of loosely diagnosing them as impingement or frozen shoulder . \\n the case also challenges the practice of routine shoulder depomedrol steroid injection , in the setting of secondary frozen shoulder , atleast in immunocompromised individuals . \\n primary idiopathic frozen shoulder is a rare condition and secondary frozen shoulder cases are often due to underlying shoulder pathology .', \"split - liver   transplantation ( slt ) is an   attractive alternative procedure to expand the donor pool in patients waiting for liver transplantation . \\n the standard split - liver procedure for a child and an adult ( adult / pediatric split liver ttransplantation , a / p slt ) , by splitting segment ii - iii for pediatric recipient and segment i - iv - v - vi - vii - viii for an adult , is an accepted surgical option with good results both for the adult and for pediatric recipient . \\n biliary complications continue to be the major cause of morbidity after slt with a reported high incidence ranging between 10% and 32% [ 1 , 2 ] . as a consequence of bile duct anatomic variations \\n , slt requires a precise knowledge of the liver anatomy [ 3 , 4 ] . \\n the challenge of this procedure is represented by a preoperative radiological assessment of the biliary anatomy often unavailable at the donor 's hospital . \\n thus the risk of biliary duct injury during the splitting procedure is usually considered higher than during living donor procedure .   in this report \\n we describe an uncommon late biliary complication that occurred after slt and was successfully treated by a multidisciplinary approach . \\n a 63-year - old male with hepatitis c - related cirrhosis was referred for liver transplantation to our institution . \\n we performed a conventional a / p slt with in situ technique providing the left lateral segment for a child ( segments ii - iii ) and leaving the right lobe graft ( segment i - iv - v - vi - vii - viii ) for an adult recipient . \\n the celiac trunk was left on the left graft while the right hepatic artery remained on the right graft . \\n the patient was transplanted using the piggy - back technique without a veno - venous bypass . \\n the biliary tract was reconstructed performing a duct - to - duct anastomosis using a t - tube by our standard technique previously described . \\n a cholangiography through the t - tube was performed on postoperative day 14 , and the t - tube was clamped before patient discharge . \\n three months after a / pslt the t - tube was removed after a cholangiography with normal findings . \\n one year after transplant the patient showed abnormal liver function tests , hyperbilirubinemia , leukocytosis , and elevated g - glutamyl transpeptidase ( ggt ) , and mild elevation in alanine transaminase ( alt ) . \\n the patient underwent a doppler ultrasound that showed ( a patent hepatic artery )   an intrahepatic bile duct dilatation and an anastomotic biliary stricture . \\n the anastomotic stricture was treated by stenting the main biliary duct during an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatoghaphy ( ercp ) without any evidence of intrahepatic biliary dilatation . \\n after this procedure the patient was submitted to a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography ( ptc ) showing a complete obstruction of segments vi and vii biliary branches near the duct - to - duct biliary anastomosis ( figure 1 ) . \\n the patient was discharged leaving the external biliary drain open allowing bile drainage and an easy access for repeated radiologic treatment and an internal stent in the common bile duct . \\n three months later the patient underwent a surgical revision because of repeated episodes of cholangitis . during surgery \\n an intraoperative cholangiography was performed through the biliary drain   confirming a bile duct dilatation at the level of segments vi and vii . \\n it was impossible to cross the biliary stricture by a torque catheter and by hydrophilic guide wire ( figure 2 ) . \\n we supposed that the segmentary bile duct branch of   posterior segments vi and vii draining in the left bile duct was unidentified and tied at the time of the in situ split - liver procedure during the parenchymal transection . \\n a primary biliary reconstruction by biliary repair or biliodigestive anastomosis was considered at high risk because of the presence of postsurgical   adhesions   sand due to fibrotic tissue replacing   the parenchymal transected area . a liver resection of the dilated segments vi and vii was considered at high risk of leaving an inadequate liver mass . \\n we decided to perform a permanent intraoperative obliteration of the dilated intrahepatic ducts by a percutaneous embolization using a nonresorbable agent . with a fluoroscopic guidance through the transhepatic access we positioned a 5-french polyethylene catheter inside the ducts , preliminary flushed by a nonionic dextrose solution . \\n we then injected the tissue adhesive agent n - butyl cyanoacrylate ( nbca , glubran 2 , gem , viareggio , italy ) mixed with ionized oil ( lipiodol , guebert , aulnay - sous - bois , france )   for opacization in a ratio of 1:5 . \\n this solution completely filled the biliary duct , and the occlusion was totally accomplished in a few seconds ( figure 3 ) . during the first 3 days after the chemical bile duct embolization , the patient had a low fever with a slightly abnormal liver function test . \\n a computed tomography ( ct ) scan performed 6 months later showed no sign of hepatic abscesses , and the bile duct dilatation was completely occupied by the nbca - lipiodol mixture . \\n one year after the procedure patient showed normal liver function tests without no episodes of cholangitis . \\n chemical bile duct embolization treatment could represent a valuable   solution to treat uncommon biliary complications . \\n these tissue adhesive glues are low - viscosity liquid monomers that undergo rapid polymerization and solidification when they come into contact with organic fluids such as bile . \\n nbca is a permanent liquid embolic material that produces long - term occlusion in vessels of various size through an inflammatory tissue response resulting in vessel thrombosis or tissue   atrophy . \\n little is known about the use of cyanoacrylate compounds , and unlike european countries   the use of glubran has not been approved by the food and drug administration yet . \\n other authors have described the efficacy of biliary duct ablation by nbca in patients with persistent postsurgical bile leaks after lobectomy or cholecystectomy . \\n vu et al . treated six patients with persistent postsurgical bile leaks as a complication after hepatic lobectomy or cholecistectomy using nbca glue for the obliteration of isolated segmental bile ducts in four cases . \\n endoscopic treatment of biliary leakage by nbca has been described by seewald in nine patients in whom primary stent placement or nasobiliary drain was unsuccessful . \\n described the use of a cyanoacrlylate in the treatment of a pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatectomy . \\n the percutaneous interventional technique represents an effective valuable approach to reduce mortality and morbidity in the treatment of biliary complications after liver transplantation . \\n the use of nbca in obliteration of a dilated bile duct seems to be a safe procedure with good results providing a less invasive option than hepatic resection above all in high - risk patients with posttransplant bile duct injuries , decreasing the morbidity associated with chronic external biliary drainage . \\n futher studies are needed to determine whether this approach is effective and safe and whether it could reduce hospital stay and costs .\", 'the study of long bones and the cells of the bone marrow is central to a myriad of research disciplines , including , but not limited to , bone biology , cancer biology , immunology , hematology , and biomechanics . \\n the bone is a highly dynamic organ that together with the cartilage forms the skeleton to provide mechanical support against loading and protection of the internal organs . \\n in addition , the mineral components of bone are a storage sink for the critical signaling molecules calcium and phosphorus , as well as other factors . \\n finally , bones house the bone marrow and , together with metabolically active bone forming osteoblasts and bone resorbing osteoclasts , provide the stem cell niche necessary for the maintenance of hematopoietic and lymphoid cell populations . \\n bone and bone marrow are affected in many disorders , often leading to bone marrow dysfunction , severe bone pain , and pathologic fracture . \\n bone is a common site of metastasis in many solid tumors , most notably breast cancer and prostate cancer , where tumor cells directly engage the bone marrow niche to initiate the vicious cycle of bone metastasis and displace hematopoietic stem cells . \\n hematopoietic malignancies including myeloma and leukemia are characterized by bone marrow dysfunction as well as deregulation of healthy bone remodeling . \\n other non - malignant skeletal disorders are also active areas of research , such as osteoarthritis , osteoporosis , scoliosis , and rickets . even in an otherwise healthy individual , biomechanical failure in a bone \\n all of these disorders represent active areas of research with the goal of identifying new preventative measures and treatment regimens to reduce morbidity and mortality . to research the plethora of roles of the bone and the bone marrow , both under physiologic and pathologic conditions \\n , it is critical for researchers to have a simple and efficient standardized method for dissection of the mouse long bones for rapid processing of large in vivo experiments . \\n the dissection protocol outlined here is suitable for all long bone analyses including ex vivo imaging , histology , histomorphometry , and strength testing , among others . \\n similarly , a standardized bone marrow isolation method with high bone marrow cell recovery and low inter - user variability is important for experimental analysis such as fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( facs ) or quantitative pcr ( qpcr ) as well as downstream applications such as primary cell culture of bone marrow cells . \\n all animal work was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee in accordance with the recommendations outlined in the guide for the care and

, cut the soft tissue away from the femoral head to release it from the acetabulum . pull the entire leg bone , including femur , knee , and tibia , up and away from the body , carefully cutting away the connective tissue and muscle connecting the leg to the skin . \\n overextend the ankle joint and again use the scissors in a twisting motion to dislocate the tibia . grasping the distal end of the tibia , taking care not to sever the tendons , pull the tibia up and away from the body and the pin board . \\n cut any remaining connective tissue attaching the long bone to the mouse at the knee . remove any additional muscle or connective tissue attached to the femur and the tibia . \\n for any applications that require the bone to remain intact ( histology , histomorphometry , biomechanical testing , etc . ) , proceed with standard in - house protocols ( as in ) . to isolate bone marrow , proceed to section 2 . \\n using the forceps , grasp the femur with the patella facing away and the proximal end ( femoral head ) down . \\n overextend the knee joint and use the scissors in a twisting motion to dislocate the tibia and femur . \\n grasp the femur with the anterior side facing away and the proximal end ( femoral head end ) down . \\n rotate the scissors back and forth to remove the condyles , the patella , and the epiphysis to expose the metaphysis . \\n remove any additional muscle or connective tissue attached to the femur using forceps , scissors , and kimwipes . using the forceps , \\n grasp the tibia with the anterior side facing away and the distal end ( ankle end )

microcentrifuge tube . place the long bones ( maximum of 2 femurs and 2 tibiae ) into the tube , knee - end \\n verify that the bone marrow has been spun out of the bones by visual inspection . \\n the bones should appear white and there should be a large visual pellet in the larger tube . \\n suspend the bone marrow in appropriate solution ( e.g. , pbs , culture media , facs buffer ) and proceed with experimental protocol ( dna , rna , or protein isolation , facs analysis , or primary cell culture ) . \\n the protocol described here is optimized for rapid dissection of the mouse femur and tibia with a minimum of damage to the bone tissue . \\n this technique is suitable for a number of downstream analyses , including biomechanics studies , histomorphometry ( figure 1a - b ) , and histology ( figure 1c ) . \\n the representative histomophometric micoct 3d reconstruction ( figure 1a - b ) demonstrates that both the cancellous bone and cortical shell are maintained that allows for accurate quantitation of the standardized structural parameters for bone histomorphometry , including trabecular number , thickness , and spacing ;  bone volume ;  and cortical thickness , among other measures . \\n the representative histologic section shows an h&e stained formalin - fixed and decalcified tibia ( figure 1c ) . \\n the image demonstrates the integrity of both the calcified bone and cellular bone marrow for histologic analysis . \\n the bone marrow isolation procedure preserves the sterility of the bone marrow space , has low handling to reduce contamination , and does not require cutting of the long bone , thus reducing loss of bone marrow yield . \\n this bone marrow is suitable for many downstream applications , including flow cytometry and pcr analyses . in addition \\n , this procedure can be used to isolate bone marrow for primary cell culture of bone marrow cells , including osteoclasts and osteoblasts ( figure 2a - b ) . \\n three - dimensional

method maintains the high structural and cellular integrity of the bones and bone marrow and has low handling time , minimizing the likelihood of user - induced fracture or bone scoring that may influence downstream analyses . \\n in addition , the centrifugation method for isolating bone marrow does not require cutting the bone to expose the bone marrow space or fluid to flush the bone marrow , reducing potential points of contamination . \\n moreover , the centrifuge technique is relatively high - throughput with lower hands - on time than other methods , thus reducing processing time . \\n high variation is inherent to in vivo mouse studies due to high mouse - to - mouse phenotypic variation . in order to maximize the research impact of expensive and labor - intensive mouse studies , it is critical to minimize technical experimental error . \\n time from animal sacrifice to downstream analysis or tissue fixation introduces experimental variation that may overcome subtle changes and reduce large differences between groups . \\n the long bone dissection and bone marrow isolation techniques described here are optimized for rapid processing of animals and samples to reduce technical variation . \\n this protocol can be widely applied to many research fields , including investigation of the bone tissue itself or interrogation of the cells of the bone marrow . \\n in addition , this straightforward approach to long bone dissection will enable researchers in related fields to directly interrogate bone contributions in order to expand our knowledge of bone marrow dysfunction in otherwise understudied pathologies . \\n ', 'tuberculosis ( tb ) is a major health issue in developing countries with over two billion people being infected with tuberculosis bacilli world wide ( 1 ) . although tb was recently regarded primarily as a disease of the developing countries it is now also on the increase in developed countries such as the united kingdom , mainly as a result of globalisation as well as an increase in immunosuppressed patients . \\n figures by the health protection agency ( hpa ) show that the cases of tb in the uk increased by 5.5% in 2009 when compared to those in 2008 ( 2 ) . \\n this caucasian patient presented to the emergency department with sudden pain localised to the ulnar aspect of her wrist . \\n x - ray of the forearm was normal and she was treated conservatively but was lost to follow up . \\n she presented again at the orthopaedic clinic 26 months later with continuing swelling and pain . \\n ultrasound showed a synovial tumour on the dorso - medial aspect of the wrist ( figure 1 ) . \\n ultrasound showing a synovial tumour on the dorsal medial aspect of the wrist however , special stains for fungi and acid fast bacilli were negative . \\n subsequently the patient developed a sinus and continued to have a chronic discharge from her left wrist . \\n x ray this time showed destruction of the ulnar styloid consistent with a bony infection ( figure 2 ) . \\n mri showed destruction localised around the ulnar head with oedematous changes extending up the shaft of the ulna ( figure 3 ) . \\n ap xray of the wrist showing destruction of the ulnar styloid consistent with a bony infection . \\n soft tissue swelling can also be noted over the dorsum of the wrist mri showing localised destruction around the ulnar head . \\n the mri also shows thickening around the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon in keeping with marked tenosynovitis at this site . \\n the patient agreed to a repeat biopsy and excision of the necrotic bone ( figure 4 ) . \\n microscopy of the specimen again showed a florid granulomatous inflammatory process with areas of fibrinoid necrosis . \\n post - operative xray of the wrist showing excision of the ulnar styloid further enquiry revealed that our patient had been experiencing lethargy but no other features to suggest tuberculosis . \\n following the diagnosis of tb , the patient recalled that in her former post as a nursing assistant , when she was much younger , she was exposed to patients with tb . \\n although improvements in its management and treatment are continuously occurring an estimated 1.8 million people died of tb in 2008 ( 1 ) . \\n extra - spinal tuberculous osteomyelitis is rare and comprises about 2 - 3% of all cases of osteoarticular tuberculosis , with the hip and knee joints being the most common following spinal involvement ( 3 ) . \\n tuberculous involvement of the ulna is uncommon and tends to be more common in the diaphysis . \\n a high index of suspicion of tb is important to obtain the correct diagnosis . in chronic soft tissue and bony infection \\n the diagnosis of tb may not be evident from the history and examination and indeed no obvious risk factors may be present as in our case . in our patient \\n the infection could have been contracted at a much younger age , when she was caring for patients infected with tuberculosis , and remained latent . \\n however no other risk factors were evident that could explain why the disease was activated after such a long period of latency . \\n it is also interesting to note that the actual distal radio - ulnar joint was not involved , most of the destruction being situated around the ulnar process . \\n although localisation of the tuberculous infection in the bone without joint involvement can occur , this is rare ( 3 ) .', 'the value of the ketogenic diet ( kd ) has been recognized in the treatment of epilepsy , although the exact mechanisms by which it exerts its effect remain an enigma . \\n they seem to be different from those of regular antiepileptic medications ( aeds ) , and discovering what they are may lead to its use in clinical situations other than epilepsy as well . \\n the kd is comprised of four elements , the changes of any of them can potentially lead to losing its anticonvulsant effect : ( 1 ) increased amount of fat , usually in a ratio of 3 to 4 grams of fat for each gram of protein and carbohydrates , ( 2 ) as low a consumption of glucose as possible , ( 3 ) caloric restriction , and ( 4 ) fluid restriction . \\n although there is some debate about the last component , clinical practice has shown that stopping fluid restriction can lead to seizure recurrence much in the same way as when stopping glucose restriction . \\n the most important result of observing the diet is the increased blood level of free fatty acids ( ffas ) . \\n the ffas are transferred into the mitochondria , a process which requires the presence of an appropriate amount of carnitine , where they are degraded into ketone bodies through  oxidation . \\n these ketone bodies include  hydroxybutyrate , acetoacetate , and acetone   ( figure 1 ) . \\n the effect of the increased amount of ketone bodies seems to be the most prominent of all other suggested antiepileptic mechanisms of the kd . \\n the degradation of the ketone bodies delivers acetyl - coa directly to the tricarboxylic acid cycle , thus increasing its turnover while bypassing the need to depend on acetyl - coa coming from glycolysis to produce atp . unlike glucose , which requires a transporter to cross the blood brain barrier , \\n the ketone bodies penetrate it easily . when this transporter is deficient , as in glut 1 deficiency , the kd is the preferred way of antiepileptic treatment , since it allows for bypassing the need for glucose . \\n children in whom the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl - coa is blocked , for instance , in pyruvate dehydrogenase ( pdh ) deficiency , will also benefit from bypassing this route . \\n hydroxybutyrate is the predominant ketone body measured in the blood , and it is used to monitor the degree of ketosis during therapy . \\n the breath of a patient who is ketotic while on the diet will often even smell of acetone . \\n acetone is one of the ketone bodies that have an anticonvulsant effect in several types of mouse seizure models . \\n the mechanism of this effect is unknown , although an effect on k2p channels has been proposed .   by means of the tca cycle , \\n acetyl - coa increases the level of the neurotransmitters glutamate and -aminobutyric acid ( gaba ) and the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in brain , respectively . \\n another product of an elevated level of free fatty acids is polyunsaturated fatty acids ( pufas ) . \\n the potential ability of pufas to block seizure activity in the brain is speculated to be associated with some rather more complicated mechanisms , including ( 1 ) directly inhibiting voltage - gated sodium and calcium channels , ( 2 ) activating a lipid - sensitive potassium channel , ( 3 ) enhancing the activity of the sodium pump to limit neuronal excitability , ( 4 ) activating peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor- ( ppar ) , and ( 5 ) inducing the expression and activity of brain - specific uncoupling proteins in the mitochondria , thereby inducing a neuroprotective effect . \\n neuroprotection can contribute to the anticonvulsant effect , but it may have other effects as well , which can lead to other clinical uses of the kd . \\n appleton and de vivo   reported that the kd increased the total quantity of bioenergetic substrates ( adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) ) and elevated the energy charge in rat brain . \\n acetoacetate , a product of  hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenation , is transferred into acetyl - coa which enters the tricarboxylic acid ( tca ) cycle . \\n the increased turnover of the tca cycle generates protons and electrons that are channeled to the electron transport chain . \\n this , in turn , drives the formation of atp from adenosine phosphate ( adp ) by atp synthase . \\n enhanced atp can either be converted to phosphocreatine for energy storage or broken into adenosine . \\n enhanced atp levels provide energy reserves for a neuron to continue functioning under stress . increased extracellular adenosine offers a neuroprotective buffer against insults , reduces excitation , and averts excessive atp demands , thus providing local seizure control and neuroprotection . \\n it was also suggested that the kd influences toward an upregulation of transcripts encoding energy metabolism enzymes and increase in the density of mitochondria in neuronal process , leading to heightened energy reserves . \\n an improved energetic status can support seizure prevention , for instance , by supporting gabaergic inhibition . \\n it is suggested that adaptive processes to the metabolic changes induced by the diet lead to changes in gene expression which in turn result in some of the above - noted changes . \\n other path of neuroprotection is modulated through decreased generation of ros which is considered to be related to pufas effect on uncoupling proteins . \\n the fact that the kd is considered a proven therapy with relatively few adverse affects and wide clinical experience , particularly in children , led to recent studies investigating new potential uses for other neurological disorders . \\n one of the most intriguing and active fields of research is the effect of a high - fat caloric - restricted diet on the survival of brain tumors cells . \\n it is hypothesized that mitochondrial abnormalities impair the ability of brain tumors to generate energy from ketone bodies . unlike normal cells , \\n malignant tumor cells have impaired genetic adaptability due to their genetic abnormalities and , therefore , increased susceptibility to environmental stress , such as fasting or caloric restriction . \\n the same genomic defects that are involved in the creation of brain tumors can be exploited for their destruction [ 3 , 10 , 11 ] .   in 1995 , nebeling et al \\n .   reported two young girls with unresectable advanced stage brain tumors who had poor response to radiation and chemotherapy . \\n they were treated with a kd and their response was remarkable , both clinically and according to positron emission tomography follow - up scans . \\n described a patient with glioblastoma multiforme whose tumor , which is very malignant , improved on the kd . surprisingly , despite the appealing efficacy of this treatment , no further human studies or clinical trials on the kd as a therapy for brain tumors have been conducted . \\n several laboratory studies in mouse and rat models have recently confirmed that inhibition of brain tumor growth is directly related with reduced levels of glucose and elevated levels of ketone bodies . \\n moreover , the kd was shown to reduce reactive oxygen species ( ros ) in the brain . \\n cancer cells need high levels of ros for the induction of angiogenesis and the production of tumor growth factors , thus , through this mechanism the kd can be protective . \\n the clinical manifestations were mainly intractable seizures that necessitated repeated admissions to the intensive care unit , as well as severe cognitive and alertness decline . \\n after the oncologists decided that antitumor treatment would be ineffective , she was started on the kd . \\n after four weeks of trial , it did not have any effect on the tumor progression . \\n however , it did have a notable improving effect on cognition , alertness , and mood of the girl , in spite of her devastating condition . \\n the beneficial effect of the kd on cognition , alertness , and mood is well recognized , and clinical experience shows that in many times it is not less important than the anticonvulsant effect . \\n the potential neuroprotective effect of the kd was what motivated investigations into its potential as a treatment option in other neurologic disorders . \\n there are increasing numbers of reports that ketosis achieved by starvation or administration of a kd has a consistent neuroprotective effect after various brain injuries in animal models . \\n one human pilot study and several animal model studies have shown improvement in autistic behavior parameters with kd treatment . \\n it remains to be further clarified whether this improvement is related to reduced epileptic activity found in up to 30% of these patients or to a primary effect of the kd . \\n a factor that can be crucial for the application of the kd in medical conditions other than intractable epilepsy is the inherent difficulties in its use . \\n dietary restriction can pose a significant problem in a child with a progressive tumor that undergoes massive chemotherapy , who may already be cachectic . \\n the kd may not be an option in a grown - up hyperactive autistic child . \\n thus , the neurologist must evaluate the appropriate clinical , familial , and environmental situations very cautiously prior to the recommendation of the kd . in conclusion , \\n the major metabolic effect of the kd is in supplying the brain with an increased amount of free fatty acids . \\n their degradation into ketone bodies , together with the load of pufas , leads to major changes in the metabolic , bioenergetic , mitochondrial , and even genetic constellation . \\n whether it may also be effective in other pathologies , especially in treating malignancies , awaits future research .', 'the endotracheal tube ( ett ) should be placed at the optimal level to avoid inadvertent complication . \\n if the ett is too deep , it increases the risk of unintended single lung ventilation . \\n on the other hand , if the ett is too shallow , it may cause vocal cord injury by the ett balloon or accidental extubation . \\n there are many methods for determining the appropriate depth of ett in adults ; fixed insertion depth according to sex ( 23 and 21  cm from the upper incisors in adult males and females , respectively ) , the use of depth marks on the ett , suprasternal palpation of the ett tip or cuff , and bilateral auscultation . \\n although chest radiography and bronchoscopy are considered an accurate method , they are not always feasible and the costs are considerable . considering the individual variation in the length of the trachea , using fixed depths or marks on the ett may result in inadequate placement of the ett . to reduce the risk of single lung ventilation or vocal cord injury , the segment between the proximal edge of the cuff and the ett tip should be placed at the mid - trachea level . if the length of the trachea can be predicted at bedside before intubation , the ett can be placed at a safe depth for each patient . \\n the purpose of this study was to determine whether surface anatomical landmarks can be used to predict the mid - tracheal level in adult patients . \\n neck computed tomography ( ct ) images of adults obtained between 2009 and 2014 were reviewed by a single reviewer after obtaining approval form seoul national university hospital institutional review board ( july 17 , 2015/no . \\n patients with

images , ct images that did not cover the entire trachea , or ct images taken in neck hyperextension ( boidin angle > 130 on scout view ) or hyperflexion ( boidin angle < 110 on scout view ) position were also excluded . \\n levels of subglottic and tracheal airway segments that include the vocal cords ( vc ) , the cricoid cartilage ( cc ) , and the carina were identified using the method described by sirisopana et al . \\n the vocal cords were identified as the most cranial level of the upper airway , with a teardrop shape below the laryngeal ventricle . anatomic level of suprasternal

from the cricoid cartilage to the suprasternal notch , mtl  =  the level of the middle of the trachea . \\n this study showed that mid - tracheal level could be estimated by the surface distance between the cc and the ssn ( extcc - ssn ) . compared with males , extcc - ssn more \\n accurately predicts the mid - tracheal level in females . in clinical practice , physicians can use extcc - ssn to determine the depth of ett so that the segment between the proximal edge of the cuff and the ett tip lies at the mid - tracheal level . \\n there are several studies that used the distance between the surface anatomical landmarks to estimate the airway length and the optimal insertion depth of endotracheal tube . \\n lee et al showed that the distance between the upper incisor and the manubriosternal angle in the neck extension position correlates with the distance between the upper incisor and the carina in the neutral neck position . \\n evron et al used the sum of the 2 distances from the mouth angle to the jaw angle and from the jaw angle to the sternal manubrium to determine the depth of ett \\n . however , these methods are complicated than single measurement of extcc - ssn due to the difficulty in locating the sternal manubrium , more than 1 measurement , and the need for full neck extension . \\n the physicians can easily apply our method with a simple measurement of the extcc - ssn to estimate the mid - tracheal level , and apply this depth during endotracheal intubation . \\n however , according to previous studies in adults , flexion and extension of the neck from neutral position are associated with the inward and outward movements of the ett . \\n conrardy et al showed that the orally intubated ett can move 1.5 ( range 0.52.0 ) cm toward the carina during flexion and 2.4 ( range 1.34.3 ) cm away from the carina during extension . \\n kim et al showed that the ett can migrate 1.3 ( sd 0.6 ; range 0.52.5 ) cm toward the carina during flexion and 1.7 ( sd 0.8 ; range 0.43.1 ) cm during extension . \\n therefore , the position of the neck should be considered when determining the optimal depth of the ett . \\n first , this study was a retrospective analysis of ct images and the distances were measured in the neutral position . \\n second , since the vc is used as a baseline of the depth of intubation in our method , it can be difficult to apply our method to patients with high cormack grades . \\n lastly , the efficacy of this method is yet to be demonstrated in clinical practice . in conclusion , \\n the mid - tracheal level , which is considered the optimal depth of ett , can be predicted by the surface distance between the cc and ssn in adults , especially in females .', \"thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine neoplasia which accounts for about 1% of human cancers . \\n mtc originates from calcitonin - producing cells ( c - cells ) of the thyroid gland and accounts for 35% of thyroid cancers . \\n mtc is relatively slow - growing tumor but , if metastasized or relapsed , it becomes very aggressive causing more than 13% of all thyroid cancer - related mortality . in the united states , \\n mtc has an incidence in children of 0.03 per 100 000 population per year with a fairly equal female to male ratio [ 4 , 5 ] . \\n mtc occurs either sporadically or in an inherited autosomal dominant manner . in adults , sporadic mtc accounts for 6575% of mtc , but in children , \\n sporadic mtc is very rare ; the vast majority of mtc diagnosed in the childhood is hereditary . \\n hereditary mtc occurs as a familial mtc ( fmtc ) or as a part of multiple endocrine neoplasia ( men ) type 2a and b syndromes , wherein other endocrine glands are also affected . \\n mtc diagnosed during childhood almost always results from a dominantly inherited or de novo activating mutations in the ret proto - oncogene , which encodes the ret receptor tyrosine kinase [ 69 ] . \\n advances in predictive genetic testing for ret mutations have enabled early diagnosis of hereditary men syndromes and prophylactic thyroidectomy in presymptomatic patients to prevent mtc . \\n the early onset of mtc in hereditary syndromes makes it an important endocrine disease that is increasingly managed by pediatric providers [ 1012 ] . in this review \\n , we discuss the etiology of pediatric mtc and currently available therapeutic modality for the cancer . \\n ret encodes a receptor tyrosine - kinase which is expressed in the neural crest - derived cell types , including thyroid parafollicular cells , neuronal cells , and adrenal medullary chromaffin cells . in these cell types \\n , ret plays a central role in regulating cell proliferation , growth , differentiation , migration and survival . in humans \\n after alternative splicing at the 3 end , ret transcripts encode three protein isoforms with distinct c - terminal ends that contain either 9 ( ret9 ) , 51 ( ret51 ) , or 43 ( ret43 ) amino acids . \\n ret exon 19 is present in all transcripts and its differential splicing at the 3 end produces distinct transcripts wherein exon 19 is either unspliced , spliced to exon 20 , or spliced to exon 21 . \\n all three resulting ret isoforms commonly contain a tyrosine ( tyr1062 ) whose phosphorylation is critical for their activation . \\n the major ret isoforms in vivo are ret9 and ret51 , which consist of 1072 and 1114 amino acids , respectively , and are usually co - expressed . \\n ret consists of an extracellular ligand binding domain , a trans - membrane domain , and an intracellular kinase domain ( figure 1 ) . \\n the extracellular domain includes four cadherin - like repeats and a highly conserved cysteine - rich region , which is located near the cell membrane . \\n the intracellular domain consists of two tyrosine - kinase subdomains , tk1 and tk2 , which contain multiple tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated during receptor activation and are required for the activation of different downstream signaling pathways of ret [ 19 , 20 ] . \\n the ligands for ret are the glial cell line - derived neurotrophic factor ( gdnf ) family proteins , including gdnf , neurturin , artemin , and perseptin . \\n activation of ret also requires the formation of a heterodimeric complex recruiting a gdnf - family receptor alpha ( gfr ) . when unbound by a ligand , ret is monomeric , unphosphorylated , and inactive . \\n when a ligand and the gfr co - receptor bind to the extracellular domain of ret , ret undergoes dimerization and autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in their kinase domains . \\n this generates the docking sites for their downstream effectors that contain the src homology 2 domain . \\n for example , gdnf - mediated stimulation of ret results in activation of the pathways regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( pi3k ) and different mitogen - activated protein kinases ( mapks ) , including the extracellular regulated kinases ( erks ) , c - jun amino - terminal protein kinases ( jnks ) , the p38 mapk and the big map kinase ( bmk1 ) erk5 [ 22 , 23 ] . \\n ret is one of the first receptor tyrosine - kinases ( rtks ) that have been found to play a role in neoplasia , being most well - known as a key etiological factor for thyroid cancer [ 6 , 24 ] . activating mutations of ret \\n abnormally enhance ret activity and can trigger tumorigenesis in certain organs although the exact underlying mechanisms are as of yet unclear . \\n first , mutations of the six cysteine residues ( cys609 , 611 , 618 , 620 , 630 , and 634 ) in the extracellular domains can promote ret dimerization via disulfide bonds and result in constitutive ligand - independent activation of ret . \\n second , mutations affecting the tyrosine kinase domains can also confer ligand - independent catalytic activity to monomeric ret . \\n these ret mutants exhibit different patterns of autophosphorylation and altered substrate specificity [ 2628 ] . indeed , \\n activation of different downstream signaling pathways is associated with different clinical features of ret mutant thyroid cancers , as observed in men2 syndromes discussed below . \\n for example , the hirschprung disease , a congenital disorder of neural crest development is caused by a loss - of - function ret mutation . \\n of note , the hirschprung disease is closely associated with men2a , demanding a genetic screening for men2a for children with familial hirschsprung 's disease . \\n a strict correlation exists between specific ret mutations and the onset of hereditary mtc ( table 1 ) [ 31 , 32 ] . \\n the detailed and up - to - date information of ret sequence variations can be obtained from the men2 ret database ( www.arup.utah.edu/database/men2/men2_welcome.php ) , which also contains links to selected men2 literature reviews , gene and protein information , and ret reference sequences . \\n the men2a subtype , accounting for 9095% of the men type 2 cases , is a highly penetrant , autosomal dominant endocrine tumor syndrome characterized by the development of mtc in > 90% of ret mutation carriers . in association with mtc \\n in addition , rare variants of men2a are also associated with cutaneous lichen amyloidosis and hirschsprung disease [ 35 , 36 ] . \\n patients with men2a usually have mutations in the extracellular cysteine - rich region of the ret tyrosine kinase receptor , usually in exon 10 ( codons 609 , 611 , 618 or 620 ) or exon 11 ( codon 634 ) ( table 1 , figure 1 ) [ 31 , 37 ] . \\n more than 80% of men2a patients exhibit a specific substitution , i.e. , cys634arg , on exon 11 . \\n mtc is generally the first manifestation of men2a syndrome and develops during early childhood , usually before age six and sometimes before age two . the men2b subtype accounts for approximately 510% of the men type 2 cases . \\n men2b patients typically feature early coincident onsets of mtc , pheochromocytoma , and gastrointestinal mucosal ganglioneuromas . \\n visible physical symptoms include mucosal neuromas of lips ( bumpy lips ) and tongue , and asthenic marfanoid body habitus [ 36 , 40 ] . \\n men2b patients usually have mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain 2 ( tk2 ) in the intracellular region of ret , which almost always ( > 95% ) lead to a single substitution , i.e. , met918thr , in exon 16 ( figure 1 ) [ 31 , 37 ] . de novo mutations , which usually occur on the paternal allele , are also common in men2b . \\n men2b is characterized by the early development of an aggressive form of mtc in all affected individuals , typically during the first year of life . \\n thus , apart from the genetic testing of ret mutations in children born to a parent with men2b , early diagnosis of men2b remains challenging . \\n individuals with men2b are likely to develop metastatic mtc at an early age if they do not undergo prophylactic thyroidectomy before age one . without this intervention , \\n fmtc is considered as the least aggressive clinical variant of men2a with decreased penetrance and/or delayed onset of the other endocrine pathologic manifestations [ 39 , 43 ] . similarly to sporadic cases , familial mtcs are isolated and are not associated with other endocrine tumors . \\n patients with fmtc harbor mutations similar to men2a in either the extracellular or intracellular region of the ret tyrosine kinase receptor [ 6 , 44 ] . \\n the onset of fmtc is relatively late , not appearing until the second or the third decade of life , and its penetrance is lower than the mtc caused by men2a and men2b [ 31 , 39 , 45 , 46 ] . \\n therefore , it is often difficult to determine fmtc based upon a family history and only careful genetic screening can distinguish between inherited and sporadic forms of mtc . \\n mtc cells secrete the polypeptide hormone , calcitonin , and the glycoprotein carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea ) , and these are used as diagnostic biomarkers for mtc . \\n mtc is most commonly diagnosed by immunohistochemical staining of fine - needle aspiration of a new thyroid nodule for calcitonin , chromogranin a , or cea . \\n serum calcitonin is the primary biochemical marker used for detection , staging , postoperative management , and prognosis for mtc patients . \\n however , in very rare cases , certain mtc cells do not secrete calcitonin , which makes diagnosis and patient follow - up difficult . \\n symptoms of mtc include neck pain , a palpable neck mass , and/or diarrhea resulting from hypercalcitoninemia . \\n the clinical course of mtc in men2 patients is variable and is determined by the codon specific mutations . in hereditary form , an age - related progression of malignant disease is observed , with lymph - node and distant metastases being typically detected years after the onset of tumorigenesis . \\n metastatic spread to cervical and regional lymph nodes ( i.e. , parathyroid , paratracheal , jugular chain , and upper mediastinum ) or to distant sites including the liver , lungs , or bone is common and is frequently present in individuals with a palpable thyroid mass or diarrhea . \\n positive lymph - node status and higher stage at diagnosis predict lower disease - free survival and higher mortality [ 5 , 5456 ] . \\n men2 is one of few hereditary cancer syndromes for which predictive genetic testing is recommended at childhood . \\n genetic testing for hereditary mtc syndromes has had an enormous impact on reducing the incidence of mtc in the families affected by these hereditary syndromes [ 57 , 58 ] . \\n genetic counseling is indicated for all children diagnosed with mtc and others who either carry or are at risk of inheriting a ret mutation . \\n children of patients with men2b should undergo ret analysis at birth , and children of patients with men2a or fmtc should undergo ret analysis before age six [ 59 , 60 ] . \\n even 610% of apparently sporadic cases of mtc demonstrate de novo germ - line ret mutations , thus making genetic testing worthwhile in all patients with mtc . \\n thus , all children with an affected parent in this setting retain a 50% risk of mtc , and surgical decisions must rely solely on clinical testing . \\n the standard treatment for mtc is surgical removal of all thyroid tissue including the posterior capsule [ 39 , 62 ] . \\n early thyroidectomy in all men2 patients can change the course of disease , either in a preventive or a curative fashion . \\n the american thyroid association guidelines task force has classified mutations based upon a model that uses the genotypephenotype correlations to rank the mutations into risk levels for the development of aggressive mtc from the lowest  a  to the highest  d  ( table 1 ) . \\n this classification may be used to predict phenotype , to recommend the timing of prophylactic thyroidectomy and the extent of surgical intervention , and to begin biochemical screening for pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism . \\n the ages at which the prophylactic thyroidectomy is recommended for the children tested positive for the ret gene mutation are as follows : ages 01 for ret mutations that carry the highest risk for aggressive metastatic mtc at young ages , i.e. , classified as  ata - d  ; before age 5 for ret mutations that carry a lower , yet still high risk of aggressive mtc at any age , i.e. , classified as  ata - c  ; after age 5 for ret mutations that carry a lower risk of aggressive mtc , i.e. , classified as  ata - b  or  ata - a ,  so long as the affected children have no other clinical signs of mtc development . \\n there is ongoing debate on what age the thyroidectomy should be recommended for fmtc patients . \\n some clinical institutes suggest the prophylactic surgery at age 1015 , depending upon the exact mutation and family history , while recommending yearly test of calcitonin levels prior to deciding the surgery . \\n indeed , the ata management guideline for mtc has been very recently revised . in the setting of a prophylactic thyroidectomy , \\n the lymph - nodes are not routinely removed since metastases are not expected to occur at this stage . in the case of clinically apparent mtc , whether sporadic or hereditary , thyroidectomy and concomitant central and compartment - oriented lateral neck dissection should be performed to increase clinical outcomes . \\n primary hyperthyroidism is rare during childhood ; therefore , parathyroidectomy is usually avoided , particularly during a prophylactic procedure . \\n dissection and autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue is not typically performed at the time of thyroidectomy unless there is enough biochemical evidence for hyperparathyroidism . \\n thyroidectomy in children is usually associated with a higher rate of complications , such as recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and hypoparathyroidism , as compared to the surgery in adults . \\n therefore , pediatric thyroidectomy must be performed by highly experienced thyroid surgeons . for individuals with a ret mutation who have not had a thyroidectomy , annual biochemical screening of calcitonin levels is recommended and , if the results are abnormal , immediate thyroidectomy is required . \\n annual serum calcitonin screening should begin at age six months for children with men2b and at age 35 for children with men2a or fmtc . \\n biochemical evidence of disease recurrence includes elevation of calcitonin and cea levels . all individuals who have undergone thyroidectomy \\n need thyroid hormone replacement therapy along with annual screening for pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism depending upon the ret mutation present in the patients . \\n mtc does not respond well to radiation therapy or the standard cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents , including doxorubicin , dacarbazine , capacitabine , and 5-fluorouracil [ 43 , 71 ] . of note , \\n the mechanism - based targeted therapies that inhibit ret and other receptor tyrosine kinases have become available for the treatment of surgically inoperable progressive mtc . \\n these include the multi - kinase inhibitors , vandetanib ( zd6474 , caprelsa ) and cabozantinib ( xl-184 , cometriq ) , which have been recently approved by the us food and drug administration [ 72 , 73 ] . a recent phase i / ii trial of vandetanib in children with mtc reported partial responses in 47% patients . \\n in general , the drug efficiency and the primary side effects , i.e. , diarrhea , rash , headache , hypertension , and nausea , were similar between children and adults . \\n phase iii trial of cabozantinib demonstrated a 28% response rate in adults with significant adverse effects . \\n therefore , there is a critical need for more effective therapies for patients with advanced mtc . \\n characterization of additional molecular pathways responsible for mtc development may allow the discovery of therapeutic targets that can be exploited to induce reduction of tumor size , disease stabilization , and symptomatic improvement [ 7782 ] . \\n mtc and the men type 2 syndromes are rare but significant endocrine diseases that are increasingly encountered by pediatricians . \\n our understanding of mtc has been greatly increased by the discovery of ret and the genotype \\n genetic tests according to the established guidelines should be performed whenever diagnosis of mtc is made . \\n due to limited adjuvant treatment options , adequate surgical treatment is critical for initial control of the disease and prophylactic thyroidectomy is recommended for children with men2a and men2b at an early age , sometimes during infancy . \\n emerging newer treatments are expected to better treat this rare but life - threatening malignancy .\", 'acquired angioedema ( aae ) , an acquired deficiency of c1esterase inhibitor , is a medically treatable condition which can cause severe abdominal pain mimicking an acute surgical abdomen . \\n this disorder is strongly associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( cll ) and other indolent lymphoplasmacytic disorders . \\n we describe a patient with known cll who developed incapacitating , recurrent severe abdominal pains , culminating in partial bowel resection . \\n wider appreciation of the possibility of aae , particularly in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders , could lead to preventive therapy and spare unnecessary surgery . \\n acquired angioedema ( aae ) is due to acquired deficiency of c1 inhibitor ( c1inh ) , resulting in excessive complement and bradykinin activities . \\n blood vessel permeability is increased ; thus , angioedema occurs . just as with hereditary angioedema ( hereditary c1inh deficiency ; hae ) , common clinical manifestations are skin swelling , laryngeal edema , and/or abdominal pain.1,2 aae often occurs in the context of lymphoplasmacytic disorders , such as monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance ( mgus ) , non - hodgkin s lymphoma , or chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( cll).1,3 among 32 patients with aae , castelli found that 13 ( 40% ) had mgus and 9 ( 28% ) had lymphoproliferative disease.3 therefore , all cases of aae should be evaluated for the possibility of underlying lymphoplasmacytic disorder . \\n conversely , when patients with known lymphoproliferative disease manifest compatible symptoms , aae should be expeditiously considered . \\n this is important because aae can be effectively treated medically , but delayed diagnosis can lead to unnecessary diagnostic procedures , therapeutic interventions , or life - threatening complications , well - illustrated by our case . \\n a 78-year - old woman with atherosclerotic vascular disease was transferred to our hospital with abdominal pain and underwent emergent laparotomy . \\n one year earlier , she had been diagnosed with rai stage i cll which had been observed without treatment . \\n two months earlier , she presented with severe abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting . over the next 8  weeks , she had six emergency room and/or hospital admissions for identical symptoms . \\n pains would begin at rest in the lower abdomen , spread to the upper abdomen , described as  gas - like  , non - radiating , constant . \\n extensive evaluation included colonoscopy , endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , magnetic resonance angiography , and abdominal aortography . \\n benign colon polyps and small gallstones were removed , mesenteric stenoses ruled out , yet pains recurred unabated . \\n there was no dysphagia , change in bowel habits , gi bleeding , fever , or sweats . \\n physical examination on transfer revealed blood pressure 130/88  mmhg , pulse 88 beats per minute , respiratory rate 20  cycles per minute , pulse oximetry of 95% on ambient air , and temperature 97.0f . \\n hemoglobin was 18.1  g / dl , hematocrit 55% , platelets 146    10/l , and leukocytes elevated to 34,500 cells/l with 47% neutrophils and 48% lymphocytes . \\n ct scan of abdomen and pelvis with iv contrast showed multiple abnormal loops of small bowel with contrast - enhanced bowel wall edema ( fig . \\n . 1a ct scan of abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast shows several abnormal loops of small bowel with a target appearance indicating

. \\n serum protein electrophoresis revealed two faint bands immunofixing as monoclonal igm kappa and igg kappa . \\n lymphocytosis and lymphadenopathy improved and c1inh activity increased to 110% . over 3  years of follow - up , abdominal symptoms never recurred . \\n approximately 145 cases have been reported of aae,3 and this is one of four cases that we have diagnosed in the last decade with abdominal pains from aae with associated cll . \\n table  1 shows characteristics of patients with cll and aae we have seen ( some briefly mentioned in a prior report).4 this is our only case to undergo surgery , allowing unique and dramatic demonstration of massive bowel edema visible radiographically , on surgical inspection and on histopathology . \\n an initial c1inh activity was reported low normal , but there can be no doubt about the diagnosis based on radiologic / surgical / histologic findings , further laboratory results , and the clinical course . \\n characteristic are very low c4 level and low c3 ; diagnostic recommendations currently add c1q and anti - c1inh antibody levels . \\n autoantibody is demonstrable in up to 70% with aae.1 our patient had monoclonal gammopathy , which frequently corresponds to the c1inh autoantibody . \\n patients with the hereditary form ( hae ) usually manifest before age 20 and give a family history of symptoms . in all our patients with cll and aae , chemotherapy and androgens increased c1inh and produced durable remission.table 1characteristics of patients with aaepatientunderlying diagnosismanifestations of acquired

aae angioedema should be borne in mind among  medical  illnesses that can mimic acute surgical abdomen , along with such other disorders as porphyria , familial mediterranean fever and sickle cell disease ( fig .  2 ) . \\n one may need to discern whether a true surgical emergency might supervene even when one of these disorders is present . \\n our patient had typical symptoms of acute bowel edema , including diffuse abdominal pain , occasionally rebound tenderness and vomiting , with spontaneous resolution within 15  days.1,2 some patients with aae have cutaneous or upper respiratory edema in addition , or instead of , bowel symptoms . \\n because of cardiovascular comorbidities , there was a high suspicion for ischemic bowel in our patient , but radiography and endoscopy did not support this . in the differential diagnosis , \\n angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors rarely precipitate angioedema , but our patient had taken benazepril many years and continued it without incident after aae therapy.fig . \\n 2algorithm for diagnosis and treatment for suspected aae algorithm for diagnosis and treatment for suspected aae in 2009 , the us fda approved the c1inh concentrate berinert p and the kallikrein inhibitor ecallantide ( kalbitor ) for treatment of acute attacks , and the c1inh concentrate cinryze for prophylaxis in severely affected patients.5 fresh frozen plasma can be given when these are unavailable . \\n c1inh concentrates are highly safe and effective ; the standard of care for decades in other countries , but us approval was delayed by concerns of virus transmissibility.1,59 doses used in the clinical hae trials may need to be higher for aae because of increased enzyme clearance . \\n a bradykinin b2 receptor antagonist icatibant ( firazyr ) is under investigation . for long - term control , \\n commonly used for prophylaxis are anti - fibrinolytic drugs or the attenuated androgen danazol , which increases c1inh synthesis at low cost.10 in conclusion , earlier suspicion for aae in our known cll patient could have spared her the morbidities of recurrent abdominal pains , hospitalizations , morbid interventions , and bowel resection . \\n wider appreciation of this disorder takes on added importance as our ability to effectively treat the problem has grown .', 'a 68-year - old woman visited the clinic with the chief complaints of pain , swelling , and a warm sensation in her left thigh for over 2 days prior to her visit . \\n the patient also complained about a warm sensation during the nighttime but body temperature was normal when measured in the clinic . \\n she had undergone a left bipolar hemiarthroplasty following a hip fracture 24 days prior to the current visit and was wearing compression stockings to prevent the occurrence of a deep vein thrombosis . \\n she had been taking aspirin 100 mg daily , fexonadine 180 mg daily , and hydrea 500 mg twice a day for a diagnosis of polycythemia vera for 1 year and was phlebotomized in a hemato - oncology setting on an irregular basis . in advance of the operation , her erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) , and c - reactive protein ( crp ) levels were 30 mm / hr and 4.99 mg / dl , respectively . \\n three days after her hip surgery , her esr and crp levels were 23 mm / hr and 6.35 mg / dl , respectively . \\n medical care was administered in close cooperation with the hemato - oncology department and the level of hemoglobin was maintained at < 12 g / dl to prevent a thrombosis prior to her operation . \\n the patient did not have a fever and her skin color seemed normal despite swelling and a slight warm sensation in the left hip and proximal femur . \\n results of a blood test showed that her complete blood count , electrolyte levels , and liver function were all within normal ranges ( white blood cell count [ wbc ] : 4,700/l , hemoglobin : 10.6 g / dl , hematocrit : 32.3% , platelet : 213,000/l , neutrophil count 67.2% , lymphocyte 24.1% , monocyte 6.8% ) whereas the esr and crp level were 38 mm / hr and 8.25 mg / dl , respectively . when compared to tests performed previously , no further observations of additional fractures , signs of infection , or loosening of inserts after the surgery \\n acute or sub - acute inflammation was diagnosed given the perfusion image of soft tissue in the left hip area as well as the blood pool image ( fig . \\n the patient was injected intravenously with antibiotics for 1 week while staying in the hospital , however , symptoms were not alleviated . in order to prevent a deep vein thrombosis , the patient started to move with the aid of a wheelchair and exercised her knee joints 3 days after the operation . \\n g / dl , a color doppler ultrasonography was performed due to her history of polycythemia vera . \\n results revealed a deep vein thrombosis in the common femoral vein as well as in the superficial femoral vein ( fig . \\n symptoms were alleviated following the administration of low - molecular - weight heparin ( enoxaparin , 40 mg ) and warfarin ( 5 mg ) for 5 days . \\n additional warfarin was prescribed ( 2.5 mg daily ) for maintenance at discharge . during her first follow - up visit 2 weeks later , no symptoms were noted and all blood test parameters were within normal ranges . \\n it has been reported that patients with polycythemia vera present with various complications related to thrombosis due to excessive blood viscosity1 ) . \\n several putative reasons have been postulated to explain such complications including hypervolemia , an increase in the volume of red blood cells , telangiectasia due to decreased blood flow velocity as well as vascular elasticity , thrombocytosis , and complex hemostatic disorders attributable to inefficient blood clotting processes2 ) . \\n thrombosis is the leading cause of death in those with polycythemia vera and has been associated with high morbidity as well . \\n approximately 12 - 49% of patients with polycythemia vera experience thrombosis and 20 - 40% will die as a result2 ) . \\n thromboembolism is one of the major complications of hip surgery and contributes to its poor prognosis . \\n warwick et al.3 ) reported that the incidence rate for a deep vein thrombosis was about 1.89% if proper medication was not provided after total hip arthroplasty . \\n therefore , in the case of the patient described in the current case report , it was reasonable to expect that she would be susceptible to the high incidence rate of thrombosis as she underwent the hip surgery based on her history of polycythemia vera . for prophylactic purposes , \\n aspirin was administrated ( 100 mg daily ) and early exercise and active movements were recommended for the patient in order to lower the risk of venous thromboembolism . in the current case report , a patient with polycythemia vera exhibited clinical symptoms and signs of a postoperative infection following bipolar hemiarthroplasty due to femoral neck fractures . \\n there was , however , a deep vein thrombosis which rendered the intravenous administration of antibiotics ineffective in the alleviation of symptoms . \\n early symptoms of a deep vein thrombosis , including swelling , pain , oppressive pain , and a warm sensation , can mimic those of a postoperative infection . \\n furthermore , features of systematic inflammatory responses such as increased levels of interleukin-6 , interleukin-8 , and crp may be observed in patients with a deep vein thrombosis . \\n collectively , these findings suggest that appropriate clinical examinations are warranted at an early stage in order to avoid making an inaccurate diagnosis4,5 ) . on the first visit after the operation , \\n the patient was suspected to have had a postoperative infection due to the simultaneous increase in esr and crp levels \\n . however , the specificity of esr and cpr levels pertaining to the diagnosis of infections is questionable , as most patients display elevated levels of esr and crp following a hip surgery6 ) . \\n these inflammatory responses stimulate the production of cytokines due to the fractures and operation per se , thus biochemical parameters for inflammation are known to be elevated in a non - specific manner . in cases without postoperative infections , elevated crp levels recover to the normal range within 3 weeks of the operation6,7 ) . in the current case report , the elevated crp level that was maintained for up to 24 days after the operation led us to suspect a postoperative infection . \\n however , the abnormally increased level of acute phase reactants ( e.g. , crp ) may be observed in patients with chronic myeloproliferative diseases ( e.g. , polycythemia vera ) and therefore further specific clinical examinations are required for an infectious diagnosis8 ) . regarding the diagnosis of a postoperative infection , \\n elevated level of serum procalcitonin may be more valuable than wbcs and crp levels7 ) . \\n regrettably , the level of serum procalcitonin was not measured in the current case but could have been informative in distinguishing between postoperative infection and a deep vein thrombosis . despite the presentation of similar clinical symptoms between a postoperative infection and a deep vein thrombosis , their etiological mechanisms are completely distinct . therefore , \\n different treatments are warranted , as patients receiving inappropriate medical treatments may experience exacerbated symptoms and conditions . \\n the potential for a deep vein thrombosis requires continuous thought and attention regarding relevant examinations for patients at high risk for thrombosis as well as for embolism ( e.g. , polycythemia vera ) .', \"brachial plexus surgery using the da vinci surgical robot is a new procedure . to evaluate the advantages and the restrictions of the technique , a cadaveric study of supraclavicular and axillary approaches was conducted . \\n we found that the axillary approach was useful and advantageous for lower roots , particularly for thoracic outlet syndrome ( tos ) . \\n this report will focus on the evaluation of axillary robotic approach as the advantages and disadvantages of supraclavicular robotic intervention have been widely discussed in the literature . \\n a human cadaver was subjected to this experiment in paris university ecole europenne de chirurgie anatomy laboratory and da vinci robot system was used . \\n the left arm was tucked along the side and the right arm was placed in a semiflexed position extending toward the anesthesia location near the head , supported by foam and blankets ( figure 1 ) . \\n a 6  cm long incision was made at the right axillar line , lateral to the edge of the pectoralis major muscle ( figure 2 ) . \\n a self - retaining chung retractor was placed into the incision to elevate the pectoralis major muscle flap . \\n the robot was docked as a camera ; right and left robotic arm were adapted in the incision area ( figure 3 ) . a 10  mm 0 downlooking scope , maryland forceps , and a curved scissors \\n the working space was maintained with the self - retaining retractor , without co2 insufflation ( figure 4 ) . \\n the subclavian artery was seen in front of the truncus and was positioned to the posterior of the working space . \\n subclavian artery was dissected from the plexus and truncus of the lower plexus was exposed with blunt dissection . \\n the plexus was exposed thoroughly from t1 to c7 levels . in this surgical setting , the operating surgeon , who has \\n a wide experience in open brachial surgery of the brachial plexus , reported that lower brachial plexus exposure was easier from the axillary working area and a more wide range of motion was achieved to manipulate the robotic tools compared to the supraclavicular exposure for lower part of the brachial plexus . \\n the development of robotic - assisted minimally invasive techniques began in urology , general surgery , and gynecology because of the generally large working spaces available in the abdomen for these types of surgeries [ 14 ] . \\n since then , other surgeons have sought to use robotic devices in other areas , such as the brachial plexus [ 5 , 6 ] . \\n brachial plexus dysfunction can be the result of shoulder trauma [ 7 , 8 ] . \\n it can also occur with tos , which encompasses three separate disorders involving compression of the subclavian artery , subclavian vein , or brachial plexus in the triangular space bordered by the first rib , clavicle , and scalene muscles [ 9 , 10 ] . \\n compression of the vessel - nerve package at the thoracic inlet has been treated with soft - tissue ( scalene muscle ) release and/or bone ( first rib ) resection . \\n surgical approaches to first rib resection may be transthoracic , transaxillary , supraclavicular , infraclavicular , or thoracoscopic [ 9 , 10 ] . however , these approaches are typically associated with incomplete resection of the most medial portion of the first rib and neurovascular complications . \\n theoretically , a minimally invasive transthoracic approach can obviate these problems , enabling complete resection of the offending portion of the first rib without neurovascular complication . \\n , respectively , reported successful results of robotic en bloc first rib resection for tos treatment via transthoracic and transaxillary approaches [ 9 , 11 ] . \\n 's techniques were only bony interventions and as being intrathoracic these need to be lung collapsed and lung complication can be waiting risk . \\n although liverneaux et al . reported techniques and results of upper brachial plexus injury intervention via robotic surgery with a supraclavicular approach , they described the disadvantages as a narrow working space and difficulty to expose the c7 vertebra [ 1 , 5 , 12 ] . to our knowledge , this report is the first to objectively describe robotic axillar brachial plexus exposure . \\n thus , we discuss the theoretical and clinical advantages and disadvantages of the axillary approach in the present report . \\n the development of robot - assisted surgery has revealed new perspectives in peripheral nerve microsurgery . minimally invasive \\n robot - assisted surgery could lead to modification of the classic algorithm for the treatment of traumatic brachial plexus lesions [ 6 , 8 ] . to date , exploration of these lesions has not been attempted less than 3 months after the traumatic event because clinical examination can not provide an accurate diagnosis or reliable prognosis in these first weeks . \\n early intervention may enable initial assessment of the lesion and repair of potentially graftable nerve roots . \\n several robotics properties are particularly adapted to microsurgery , such as high - resolution three - dimensional ( 3d ) visualization with up to 40 magnification , up to 10-fold magnification of surgical movements , elimination of physiological tremors , and the provision of ergonomic work conditions for otherwise uncomfortable surgery . \\n robotic surgical systems allow high - definition magnified 3d visualization of the operative field , provide significant instrument maneuverability , even within a confined space , and may overcome the shortcomings of conventional approaches [ 2 , 5 ] . \\n axillary ( infraclavicular ) brachial plexus intervention via robotic surgery has not been described previously . \\n axillary intervention was previously performed as an open procedure to expose the plexus or resect the first rib for the treatment of tos . \\n martinez et al . described first rib resection via robotic surgery but not to address plexus injury without transthoracic exposure , a novel minimally invasive approach to the first rib from inside of the chest . \\n in addition , gharagozloo et al . reported first rib resection via transthoracic robotic surgery for paget - schroetter disease . \\n 's techniques were considered more useful for lower brachial plexus viewing and assessing according to gharagozloo et al . \\n the experience of the whole surgical team with robotic technology is important for the procedure . during learning curve period , \\n two staff surgeons are required to participate in all procedures to ensure the safety of the program [ 5 , 9 ] . \\n martinez et al . reported importance of the learning curve , not only for the surgeon but also for the entire surgical team and 180 minutes for the initial 10 cases . \\n reported exclusion criteria include a history of previous incision in the same area and obesity , which present difficulties in robotic surgery initiation . \\n other drawbacks of this new surgical approach are the increased cost of surgical equipment and longer operating time , especially during the learning curve period . \\n however , we believe that the avoidance of a classic incision leads to significant patient satisfaction for cosmetic reasons and we believe that demand for this procedure from a select group of patients justifies the exploration of alternative ways to avoid classic brachial plexus exposure . \\n this report presents our initial experience with robot - assisted axillary exposure of the brachial plexus region . in our opinion \\n robotic surgery will be used routinely in the future for brachial plexus surgery and particularly for tos that is caused by bone and/or soft tissue . however , newer dedicated surgical instruments need to be developed and further studies should be conducted to evaluate in vivo application and results of this novel approach .\", 'gastric cancer is the second most frequent neoplasm of the alimentary tract after the large intestine . \\n 5,103 people in poland were affected by it in 2008 . the case - to - death ratio of around 1 indicates unfavourable prognosis as to recovery from this disease [ 1 , 2 ] . \\n this poor result is determined by the fact that it is rarely ( only in around 8% ) detected in the form of early gastric cancer , in the mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic phase . in most patients \\n it is diagnosed at a higher degree than the 1st degree of disease progression and its classic symptoms are weight loss , continuous and dull pain in the epigastrium , loss of appetite , nausea , vomiting and chronic bleeding [ 3 , 4 ] . \\n the existence of gastric cancer metastasis to the ureter has been described twice in the literature to date . \\n a female patient , age 67 , was diagnosed at the district hospital ( 22.04 - 30.04.2010 ) because of intensified symptoms of left - sided renal colic . based on the conducted usg and single - phase computed tomography tests of the abdominal cavity and the pelvis , dilation of the ureter \\n was found because of its infiltration by a pathological focus with the dimensions of 28 mm  15 mm . \\n another lesion was located nearby at the level of the left iliac muscle  30 mm  27 mm  20 mm , adhering to the sigmoid colon . \\n tissue infiltration of the pelvis minor wall was found descending in the direction of the left appendages . \\n colonoscopy was conducted and in this test the large intestine was described without pathology , while the gynaecological usg test confirmed the presence of fluid in the pelvis . during her stay the patient was treated with analgesic and diastolic medication and then referred for further treatment at the regional oncology centre . because of reported pain complaints , she was immediately admitted to the department of oncological surgery on the day of her visit to the outpatient clinic ( 04.05.2010 ) . \\n the urologist consulting the patient indicated the possibility of kidney damage due to ureteral obstruction with recommendation for an accelerated operation . \\n therefore , pre - operative diagnostics were not extended beyond the tests received from the district hospital . \\n the patient underwent surgery on 10.05.2010 and intraoperatively , besides the expected neoplastic tumour of the left ovary with infiltration of the ureter , numerous neoplastic foci were also found : a sigmoid colon tumour , a caecum tumour , a tumour of the body of the stomach and two single tumours in the omentum . \\n because of the resectability of the neoplastic foci described above , the operation plan adopted earlier was changed and the following were performed in succession with palliative intention : partial gastrectomy by the rydygier method , right - sided hemicolectomy , left ovariectomy and sigmoid resection . after restoring the continuity of the alimentary tract , \\n the tumour occluded the lumen , which is why segmental ureterectomy was performed with end - to - end anastomosis over a pigtail catheter . \\n the patient passed the post - operative period without complications , except a two - day fever . \\n because of the expected alimentary tract failure , parenteral nutrition was included on the 1st day after the procedure and blood deficits were supplemented with 2 units of erythrocyte mass and 7 units of plasma . \\n on the 9th day after the operation , the patient was discharged home in a good general condition with recommendations for further treatment . \\n the received postoperative histopathological protocol indicated that the stomach was the origin of the neoplastic process . \\n to lauren ) , type i ( acc . to goseki ) , of a stomach adenocarcinoma with a g2 malignancy degree , with occupation of the whole thickness of the stomach wall , with the following immunohistochemical characteristics : ck7(+++ ) , ck20(++ ) , ca125(+ ) , mucicarmine(+ ) . \\n neoplastic infiltrations along nerves and neoplastic embolisms of blood vessels , as well as metastatic foci in the greater omentum , were observed in the specimen . because of the palliative partial gastrectomy type , only 3 lymph nodes were described in this specimen and all of them contained neoplastic cells . besides the above \\n , histopathological confirmations were obtained of the metastatic character of the foci in the ovary , caecum and sigmoid colon . \\n the cancer occupied large and small intestine walls without infiltration of the mucous membrane and the immunohistochemical characteristics were identical as for the primary lesion . according to the above protocol , excision within tissues with a healthy margin of these organs was achieved . \\n the widening of the left ureter is visible ( marked by arrow ) focus of metastatic carcinoma in the ureter wall \\n . microscopic section , he staining , magnification 40 neoplastic invasion in the ureter wall . \\n microscopic section , he staining , magnification 100 it is interesting biologically and constitutes the basis for this paper that the ureteral tumour was described by the pathologists not as a neoplastic infiltration encroaching on the ureter , but as a metastatic focus to the ureteral wall . \\n after the operative treatment , the patient was qualified for palliative chemotherapy and received it from 28.07.2010 . \\n the first treatment course was according to the eox regimen ( oxaliplatin and capecitabine ) , but because of the occurrence of neutropenic fever the regimen was changed to pf ( cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil ) . \\n she again received only one course and the treatment was changed once more because newly formed metastatic foci in the liver were located in imaging tests . \\n next , three chemotherapy courses were administered according to the folfiri regimen ( irinotecan , leucovorin and 5-fluorouracil ) , but only until 11.11.2010 because due to progression of changes in the liver described in examinations the chemotherapy was discontinued and the patient was qualified for symptomatic treatment . according to our knowledge \\n treatment of gastric cancer in the disseminated phase of the disease aims at extension of life and achieving a good palliative effect . \\n the recommended methods , allowing the above to be achieved , are chemotherapy or combination radiochemotherapy . in an advanced stage , \\n palliative operations on this organ are performed for life reasons and serve to eliminate complications such as bleeding , perforation or obstruction of the organ . \\n it is indicated that the above complications forced surgical intervention in 1/4 of the patients previously disqualified from operative treatment because of the presence of metastatic foci . according to literature data , patients operated on by palliative resection in the disseminated phase of the disease achieve a survival time of between 9 and 15 months . the survival time is limited by the number of metastatic foci ; when their number is higher than two foci , no statistically significant differences are observed in this scope \\n . the value of these procedures is increasing because of the reported low perioperative mortality and the observed significant improvement in the further quality of life for these patients [ 513 ] . \\n it seems that the operative procedure conducted in the presented patient allowed a good palliative effect to be achieved along with loss of severe colic and maintenance of kidney function . \\n the literature often presents , as characteristic of gastric cancer , blood - borne metastasis to the ovary , termed a krukenberg tumour . \\n this is a term generally defining metastasis to the ovary , mainly gastric cancer and next colon cancer . \\n metastases from other organs , such as the lungs , the mammary gland and the uterus , are also possible , though much rarer . \\n krukenberg tumours are encountered in the course of 2 - 4% of disseminated neoplastic processes . \\n this is a negative prognostic factor , with varying median survival time after its diagnosis : 12 - 13 months in the course of gastric cancer compared to 17 - 29 months in the course of large intestine cancer . \\n this undoubtedly results from biological differences in the course of these neoplasms [ 1423 ] . in summary , \\n the available literature sources have described this only twice to date ( in 1976 and 2000 ) . \\n however , nephroureterectomy was conducted in these quoted cases [ 24 , 25 ] . in the presented patient \\n the kidney was spared and healing of the ureter after end - to - end suture was achieved . \\n the dissemination of a neoplasm with extremely rarely encountered symptomatology described above is an interesting experience which we wanted to share . \\n the beginning of the symptomatic disease as a left - sided renal colic is , in itself , a previously unreported case .', 'eosinophilic gastritis is an extremely rare disease that is characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the various layers of the gastrointestinal tract in the absence of any definite causes of eosinophilia . \\n patients with eosinophilic gastritis have diverse symptoms , including abdominal pain , emesis , abdominal distension , and weight loss . \\n these symptoms are associated with eosinophilic infiltration of the various layers of the gastrointestinal tract . \\n the disease has to be distinguished from generalized eosinophilic disorder presenting with involvement of other organs . \\n a 52-year - old female patient visited another hospital because of epigastric pain and tenderness . \\n she had no history of allergic diseases such as eczema or atopy , or food or drug allergies . \\n , she had undergone esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( egd ) , which revealed multiple focal ulcerative lesions with diffuse discoloration and edematous change of the rugae in the gastric fundus , cardia , and upper body ( fig . \\n the symptoms had been recalcitrant to treatment with proton pump inhibitors , fasting , and fluid . \\n she had reported no nausea , vomiting , hematemesis , or melena . on admission , \\n her blood pressure was 110/60 mm hg , pulse rate 76 beats per minute , respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute , and body temperature 36.2. physical examination revealed tenderness of the epigastric area . \\n her white blood cell count was 22,770/mm with markedly increased eosinophils ( 5,009/mm , 22% ) . \\n the c - reactive protein concentration was 13.95 mg / dl . her other blood chemistry test results were normal . \\n the tests for viral markers included hepatitis a , b , and c virus and human immunodeficiency virus ; those for autoimmune antibodies included anti - nuclear , anti - double stranded dna , and anti - neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies ; and those for tumor markers included -fetoprotein , carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 , and carcinoembryonic antigen . \\n the serological test for toxocara antibodies ( igg ) was positive , whereas those for echinococcus , paragonimus westermani , sparganumi , and trichinella antibodies were negative . \\n the chest and abdomen radiographic examinations were normal . to investigate the cause of the epigastric pain and tenderness , \\n abdominal computed tomography was performed , which revealed severe edematous wall thickening with focal localized low attenuation of the fundus and cardia of the stomach ( fig . \\n she underwent a repeated egd , which showed diffuse necrotic change in the fundus , cardia , and upper body ( fig . \\n a biopsy specimen was obtained during egd ; a rapid urease test ( clotest ) revealed no evidence of helicobacter pylori . on histopathologic evaluation , \\n the gastric surface was found to be eroded and the underlying lamina propria showed dense eosinophilic infiltration . \\n she was treated with empirical intravenous antibiotics ( cefoperazone and metronidazole ) immediately after her transfer because infectious gastritis was not ruled out . \\n although she was treated with a broad - spectrum anthelmintic ( albendazole ) , antibiotics , proton pump inhibitor , and prokinetic agent during the next 5 days , her symptoms became worse . \\n eosinophilic gastritis was diagnosed according to the clinical pictures , laboratory findings , and endoscopic findings . \\n she was immediately started on methylprednisolone ( 62.5 mg / day ; this dose was maintained for 7 days ) . \\n therefore , she underwent a repeated short - term follow - up egd that showed regenerative epithelial tissue with peeling off , of the necrotic tissue ( fig . \\n she underwent a repeated egd that showed the replacement of white color scar tissue ( fig . \\n currently , she is being treated with 30 mg / day prednisone and is showing considerable clinical improvement . \\n eosinophilic gastroenteritis is an uncommon and rarely reported disorder characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the various tissue layers of the digestive tract in the absence of any definite causes of eosinophilia , without eosinophilic infiltration in other organs . \\n the diagnosis of eosinophilic gastroenteritis is based on the following criteria : the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms , histological presentation of eosinophilic infiltration in tissue layers of the digestive tract , presence of high eosinophil count in ascites , and no evidence of parasitic infection or eosinophilic involvement of extraintestinal organs . \\n eosinophilic gastroenteritis can involve any portion of the gastrointestinal tract from the esophagus to the rectum , and the stomach is the most commonly involved organ , especially the antrum . in eosinophilic gastritis , \\n the endoscopic features are rather extensive : rugal fold thickening , erythema , friability , nodularity , gastric outlet obstruction , gastric ulcer , and even a normal mucosa . \\n although not clearly defined , the common pathophysiological mechanism of this disease is associated with eosinophilic infiltration and degranulation in specific tissue layers of the digestive tract . \\n this eosinophilic recruitment and activation regulated by diverse cytokines is a part of the host immune mechanism in the gastrointestinal mucosa ; however , it can be a type of serious allergic or inflammatory reaction in the deeper tissue layers of the gastrointestinal tract . although there is no treatment consensus on eosinophilic gastroenteritis , \\n several studies report good results with steroids in dosages from 20 to 40 mg / day , for 6 to 8 weeks [ 7 - 10 ] . in some case studies , \\n leukotriene modifiers such as montelukast or mast cell stabilizers such as sodium cromoglycate have been proposed to be helpful for symptomatic improvement . \\n antihistamines such as ketotifen or immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil are also used in the treatment of eosinophilic gastroenteritis ; however , their therapeutic effects are not clear and would require more studies . \\n although rare , eosinophilic gastritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and peripheral blood eosinophilia . \\n lymphoma of the stomach , gastric cancer , and crohn disease involving the stomach may demonstrate endoscopic features similar to those of eosinophilic gastritis . \\n gastrointestinal parasitic infection should be considered in patients with abdominal discomfort , weight loss , and peripheral eosinophilia . in particular , infestations by hookworms , \\n ascaris , strongyloides , toxocara , trichuris , and intestinal capillaria should be considered in patients from endemic areas . in this case , the concentration of the antigen - specific ige to the a. simplex was 0.57 \\n moreover , the serology for toxocara antibodies ( igg ) was positive . however , this is not clinically significant in korea because koreans often consume raw fish , which causes repeated exposures to anisakis . \\n in addition , she had not had contact with any animals , including dogs and cats , at least for several years . \\n moreover , she was treated with albendazole for 5 days , and her symptoms had become worse . after steroid treatment , the symptoms disappeared and the eosinophil count decreased to the reference range . \\n moreover , the follow - up egd showed regenerative epithelial tissue with peeling off , of the necrotic tissue \\n . she had undergone several egds that showed diffuse necrotic change in the fundus , cardia , and upper body . \\n the etiology includes thromboembolism and occlusion of major arterial supply , ingestion of corrosive agents , volvulus of the stomach , endoscopic hemostatic injections , and infectious gastritis . in this case \\n thus , the possible cause of gangrene could be infection , and she was treated with empirical intravenous antibiotics ( cefoperazone and metronidazole ) . \\n however , she was treated with broad - spectrum antibiotics during the next 5 days , and her symptoms became worse . \\n the necrotic portion of the gastric high body is very vulnerable site of retching injury . \\n this retching injury is called prolapse gastropathy syndrome , a clinical syndrome involving the invagination of part of the gastric mucosa into the lower esophagus . \\n direct trauma to the mucosa occurs when the gastric mucosa becomes incarcerated through the lower esophageal sphincter . \\n in addition , the endoscopic findings and histopathologic results were not compatible to prolapse gastropathy syndrome . on the basis of the clinical picture , laboratory findings , and therapeutic results , we concluded the diagnosis of eosinophilic gastritis presenting as necrotizing gastritis in our patient . \\n this case highlights the reality of eosinophilic gastritis presenting as necrotizing gastritis , and that endoscopy and histopathological examination of the biopsies are the most useful tools for the diagnosis of eosinophilic gastritis presenting as necrotizing gastritis . \\n eosinophilic gastritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with necrotic gastritis who do not respond to empirical treatment .', \"gossypiboma ( retained surgical sponge ) describes a mass of cotton or sponge that is left behind in the body cavity during a surgical operation . \\n these foreign bodies can often mimic tumors or abscesses when detected clinically or with radiation . \\n in fact , surgical sponges without opaque markers are the leading cause for the difficulty of a correct diagnosis . here , we present a case in which a foreign body , gauze without radiopaque markers , was left behind during a procedure that involved the removal of an intrapelvic tumor . after a computed tomography ( ct ) \\n scan had revealed information leading to an inaccurate diagnosis , an accurate diagnosis of gossypiboma was successfully made using endoscopic ultrasound - fine - needle aspiration ( eus - fna ) . \\n a 60-year - old female patient was referred with an unexpected detection of an intrapelvic tumor during a routine ct scan . \\n the patient 's medical history included a hysterectomy and a left side ovariectomy at the age of 27 . \\n the ct scan revealed a 45 mm tumor in the patient 's pelvis [ figure 1a and b ] , which was diagnosed as a gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( gist ) , a chronic expanding hematoma or leiomyoma . a forward - view eus ( tgf - uc260j , olympus optical co. , tokyo , japan ) identified a low echoic lesion when scanned from the sigmoid colon . \\n fna was performed with a 22-gauge needle ( ezshot2 , olympus optical co. , tokyo , japan ) by using the forward - view eus [ figure 2 ] . \\n examination of the fna specimen revealed a foreign body ( string of gauze ) displaying macrophage cells and necrotic tissue [ figure 3 ; hematoxylin and eosin , original magnification 40 ] . during the surgery , \\n histological examination of the tissue adjacent to the foreign body revealed granuloma formations with fragmented silken threads [ figure 4 ; hematoxylin and eosin , original magnification , 100 and 200 ] . \\n a : sagittal section ( black arrow ) ; b : horizontal section ( black arrow ) . \\n endoscopic ultrasound ( eus)-fine - needle

threads \\n gossypiboma describes a mass of cotton or a sponge that is retained in the body after a surgery . \\n gossypiboma causes foreign body reactions of the surrounding tissue since they are inert and show no specific decomposition . in this case , \\n radiopaque sponges were not used , and there were no adverse symptoms in the 30 years postsurgery . \\n the typical appearance of gossypiboma shows a spongiform pattern with gas bubbles . in typical cases , \\n however , it can be difficult to diagnose the disorder with ct scans in cases without gas bubbles . in the case described in this paper , \\n radiologists using findings from a ct scan , initially and incorrectly diagnosed the lesion as gist with fibrosis . \\n however , the disorder was correctly diagnosed by a team of gastroenterologists using eus - fna . \\n the eus - fna procedure revealed a segment of string in a fixed foreign body in the pelvis . \\n the application of eus using curved linear array ( cla ) endoscopes in the lower gi tract has been limited to the rectum and distal sigmoid colon because of the oblique - viewing optics . \\n there were case reports using oblique - viewing cla echoendoscopes to evaluate lesions proximal to the sigmoid colon , but advancement of the cla echoendoscope beyond the sigmoid required the use of an overtube or a guide wire previously placed with a colonoscope . \\n binmoeller et al . have reported the feasibility and safety of the front - view forward - array echoendoscope for evaluating right colon lesions . \\n thus , we used a front - view forward - array echoendoscope to safely evaluate the intrapelvic tumor and sample the tissue . \\n a correct diagnosis was obtained using this method . in summary , this is the first known case report diagnosing gossypiboma by eus - fna .\", \"to demonstrate the usefulness of enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography ( edi - oct ) in investigating choroidal lesions inaccessible to ultrasound sonography . \\n in a 60-year - old woman with an asymptomatic choroidal nevus , normal oct was used to observe the macula and edi - oct to image the choroidal nevus that was inaccessible to ultrasound . \\n the exact location of the lesion in the choroid and the dimensions of the nevus were measured . \\n the lesion was located in the superior macula , and the nevus was homogeneous in its reflectivity . \\n we observed a thickened choroid delineated by the shadow cone behind it , measuring 1,376  325 m in the larger vertical cut and 1,220  325 m in the larger horizontal cut in an image with a 1:1 pixel mapping and automatic zoom . \\n edi - oct appears to be an excellent technique for measuring choroidal nevi and all choroidal lesions accessible to oct imaging by depicting their exact location in the choroid , their dimensions , and their demarcation from the surrounding healthy tissue , thus allowing for a more efficient and accurate follow - up . \\n choroidal nevus is the most common tumor of the ocular fundus , present in 7% of the white population [ 1 , 2 ] . despite its benign nature \\n , it presents a risk of visual loss and visual field loss , and can rarely transform into malignant melanoma . \\n optical coherence tomography ( oct ) and ultrasonography have been used for imaging choroidal nevi . recently \\n , enhanced depth imaging oct ( edi - oct ) has been used in order to measure choroidal thickness in normal and pathologic eyes [ 3 , 4 ] . here \\n , we report a case of a flat choroidal nevus inaccessible to ultrasound sonography that was evaluated by edi - oct . \\n a 60-year - old woman was referred to our department with an asymptomatic choroidal nevus in her left eye . her best - corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes . slit lamp and fundus examinations of the right eye were normal . in the left eye , the anterior segment was normal ; however , on fundoscopy a choroidal nevus located in the superior macula was observed ( fig . \\n spectral - domain ( sd ) oct ( heidelberg engineering , heidelberg , germany ) revealed normal foveal thickness ( fig . \\n 2 ) . the flat nevus was inaccessible to ultrasound sonography , and edi - oct was used to image its posterior surface ( fig . \\n edi - oct is a new technique that consists of positioning a heidelberg sd - oct close enough to the eye in order to obtain an inverted image , averaged for 100 scans . \\n the advantage of this technique is that the sensitivity of the imaging in deeper tissue layers is increased , and thus the obtained measurements are more accurate . \\n we employed this technique to image the location of the nevus in the choroid and obtain its dimensions as a reference measure for the follow - up examination ( fig . \\n 3 ) . heidelberg sd - oct provides an exact correlation between the oct image and the infrared photograph . as infrared light \\n is absorbed by melanin , the nevus appears brighter . in the edi - oct image

inaccessible to ultrasound sonography and accessible to oct imaging , displaying simultaneously the lesion and the retinal changes . \\n it is a reproducible examination that allows depiction of the exact location of the nevi in the choroid , their dimensions and their demarcation from the surrounding healthy tissue . to date , the software available for sd - oct does not allow for objective measures . \\n the subjective measures obtained are useful upon comparison with the follow - up images . in order to limit the possibility of bias \\n , these follow - up images must be obtained and

of choroidal nevi . \\n \", 'kelch - like ech - associated protein 1 ( keap1)-nuclear factor e2-related factor 2 ( nrf2 ) is a major cellular pathway that protect normal cells against oxidative and xenobiotic damage.1 nrf2 is an essential transcription factor for antioxidant and detoxification genes and is crucial for the chemopreventive effect of various phytochemicals against carcinogenesis . \\n representative chemopreventive agents that induce nrf2 include carotenoids , curcumins , cyclic lactones , diterpenes , dithiolethiones , epithionitriles , flavonoids , indoles , isothiocyanates , organosulfides , and phenols.2,3 accumulating evidences have demonstrated that phytochemicals can protect cells from oxidative stress related diseases including inflammatory , cardiovascular , and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer , through nrf2-dependent responses . \\n paradoxically , recent researches demonstrated the dark side of nrf2.4 cancer cells acquire a growth advantage by eliminating keap1-mediated negative control of nrf2 , which leads to activation of the nrf2-dependent defense response.4 constitutive upregulation of nrf2 has been found in many types of cancers , including skin , breast , prostate , lung , head and neck , and endometrial cancer.5 overexpressed nrf2 provides a growth advantage for cancer cells by protecting those cells from oxidative stress and anticancer agents , thus contributing to chemoresistance.5 in this review , we summarize the therapeutic development of nrf2 inhibitors that enhance the efficacy of the current cancer treatments . \\n nrf2 is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor with 7 domains from neh1 to neh7 . \\n neh1 has dna binding motifs.6 neh3 , neh4 , and neh5 have domains involved in the transactivation of nrf2 target genes by binding coactivators . \\n neh2 has a major regulatory domain with 2 binding sites for keap1 named etge and dlg ( fig . \\n keap1 has 5 functional domains including kelch , intervening region ( ivr ) , broad complex / tramtrack , bric - a - brac domain ( btb ) , an n - terminal region ( ntr ) , and a c - terminal region ( ctr).3 cysteine residues of ivr play as a sensor for reactive oxygen species ( ros ) . \\n the btb domain has a cys151 residue and is responsible for nrf2 ubiquitination through binding to cullin e3 ubiquitin ligase ( cul3)-based ubiquitin e3 ligase ( fig . \\n 1a ) . under unstressed conditions , nrf2 forms a complex with keap1 , leading to polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26s proteasome ( fig \\n . 2a).7 upon exposure to a variety of stressors , including ros , toxicants , and carcinogens , nrf2 is released due to modification of the cysteine residues of keap1 ( fig . \\n 2b).8 two mechanistic models have been proposed for the regulation of nrf2 : the hinge and latch model and the keap - cul3 dissociation model.810 in the hinge and latch model , 2 binding motifs of the neh2 domain in nrf2 have different affinities.9 for the ubiquitination , both the dlg and etgf motifs should be occupied by keap1 proteins . \\n ros modify the cysteine residues of keap1 , leading to the release of the dlg motif ( latch ) without changing the etgf motif ( hinge ) on neh2 . \\n another model is the keap - cul3 dissociation model in which oxidative stress disrupts the keap1-cul3 e3 ligase interaction without changing the conformation of keap1.8 nrf2 stabilization with de novo synthesis increases the cytoplasmic level of nrf2 . \\n nrf2 translocates into the nucleus and binds to an antioxidant response element ( are ) as a heterodimer with musculo - aponeurotic fibrosarcoma ( maf ) to recruit a transcriptional coactivator and promote thetranscription of various cytoprotective genes that are associated with antioxidant and detoxification enzymes . upon recovery of cellular redox homeostasis , keap1 translocates to the nucleus to dissociate nrf2 from the are resulting in degradation of nrf2.11 \\n nrf2 binds to ares in promoter regions of various genes that regulate the cellular response to oxidative and xenobiotic stress . \\n nrf2 target genes include antioxidant genes and phase ii enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 ( ho-1 ) , nad(p)h : quinone oxidoreductase 1 ( nqo1 ) , glutathione s - transferase ( gst ) , and glutathione peroxidases . \\n the are - bearing genes that are regulated by nrf2 in humans have been studied using microarray analysis of genes induced by chemopreventive agents or knockout of keap1 in human cell lines.2 these genes can be categorized into 5 groups : antioxidant genes ( gclc , gclm , gpx2 , gsr , slc7a11 , srxn1 , and txnd1 ) , nadph - generating enzymes ( g6pd , me1 , and pgd ) , metal - binding proteins ( fth1 , ftl , mt1 , and mt2 ) , drug - metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters ( akr1b1 , akr1b10 , akr1c1 , akr1c2 , akr1c3 , akr1c4 , cbr1 , gstm3 , mrp2 , nq1 , and ptgr1 ) , and stress response proteins ( gadd45 , hmox1 , hsp40 , and hsp70).2 knockdown of keap1 in human keratinocytes resulted in upregulation of 23 mrnas while akr1b1 , akr1b10 , and akr1c1 were induced to the greatest extent , showing increases of between 12- and 16-fold indicating that aldo - keto reductases could be useful biomarkers for nrf2 activation.12 as keap1 is responsible for inhibitor kappa b ( ib ) kinase beta ( ikk- ) ubiquitination , upregulation of some of these genes could be attributable to the increase of nuclear factor - kappa b ( nf-b ) activity.13 expression profiling in mice has revealed that nrf2 regulates approximately 100 genes and that two - thirds of nrf2-target genes are not involved in detoxication or antioxidation . instead , many of the target genes are associated with inflammation and immunity proteins.2 \\n the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( ahr ) is a transcription factors that mediates the biological effects of its xenobiotic ligands including dioxin.14 the ahr activates the transcription of nqo1 and other genes through the xenobiotic - responsive element ( xre).15 ahr induces the direct binding of nrf2 to promoters or indirectly produces reactive intermediates that trigger the nrf2 signaling pathway.16 the cross - talk between nf-b and nrf2 is more complex . \\n several chemopreventive agents , such as sulforaphane , epigallocatechin-3-gallate , and curcumin , induce nrf2 signaling with concomitant repression of nf-b.14 the nf-b p65 subunit re - presses the nrf2-are pathway by preventing creb binding protein ( cbp ) from binding nrf2 through competitive interaction or by promoting the recruitment of histone deacetylase 3 ( hdac3 ) , a corepressor , to the are.17 in chondrocyte apoptosis , shear - induced cyclooxygenase-2 , an nk-b target gene , can suppress phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase ( pi3k ) activity , causing a reduction in thenrf2-mediated transcriptional response.18 in contrast , nrf2 inhibits the activity of nf-b by attenuating phosphorylated ib . \\n nrf-2 target genes , including ho-1 have been reported to negatively affect nf-b activation.19,20 p53 has been reported to suppress the nrf2-dependent transcription of antioxidant response genes by directly interacting with are - containing promoters . \\n previous studies have suggested that the function of this negative regulation is to prevent the formation of antioxidant environment , which could hinder the induction of apoptosis by p53.21 in contrast , direct targets of p53 could upregulate nrf2 activity . \\n studies have shown that p21 inhibits the degradation of nrf2 by interacting with the dlg motif , leading to upregulation of antioxidant genes.22 these dual functions of p53 toward nrf2 indicate that p53 may decide the fate of damaged cells whether to repair the damaged cells or apoptosis . \\n nrf2 is also involved in autophagy by inducing p62 which is a receptor for autophagic degradation . \\n as p62 could block binding between nrf2 and keap1 , p62 contributes to the activation of nrf2 target genes in response to oxidative stress creating a positive feedback loop.23 \\n the association of nrf2 overexpression and chemoresistance has been reported in many cancers including non - small cell lung cancer , stomach cancer , endometrial cancer , and osteosarcoma.2427 overexpression of nrf2 target genes was also found in a variety of solid tumors.28 ho-1 overexpression was found in brain cancer , prostate cancer , and renal cancer.29,30 nqo1 is known to be overexpressed in hepatoblastoma , colon cancer , breast cancer , and non - small cell lung cancer.31 several mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of keap1-nrf2 signaling in cancer . \\n mutation of keap1 can result in accumulation of nrf2 in nucleus through decreased degradation or inhibition of nuclear export.28 in non - small cell lung cancer , heterozygous mutation of keap1 ( 8% of patients ) was reported to be sufficient for nrf2 overexpression.32 in addition to lung cancer , mutations in the keap1 gene were found in various cancers including breast ( 2% ) , colon ( 8% ) , gastric ( 11% ) , liver ( 9% ) , ovary ( 19% ) , and prostate ( 8%).3336 mutations in the neh2 domain of nrf2 were found in lung ( 11% ) , cancer ( 6% ) , and head and neck cancers ( 25%).37,38 all of these mutations were somatic mutations . \\n mutation of egfr , kras , braf , myc , and the bcr - abl fusion can activate nrf2 , resulting in enhancement of ros detoxification and other oncogenic roles of nrf2 , including chemoresistance.3941 furthermore , posttranslational modifications can activate the keap1-nrf2 signaling pathway . \\n hypermethylation of the keap1 promoter was found in 47% of lung cancer patients and this feature was associated with poor outcome.42 epigenetic regulation of keap1 was also found in malignant glioma , colon cancer , and breast cancer.4345 \\n in addition to the upregulation of cytoprotective genes , constitutive expression of nrf2 may confer a survival advantage to cancer cells by promotion of cell proliferation , chemoresistance and inhibition of apoptosis . \\n an active pi3k - akt pathway augments the nuclear accumulation of nrf2 which then re - directs glucose into the anabolic pathway to increase metabolism , indicating the reinforcement of metabolic reprogramming by nrf2.46 nrf2 could mediate cell proliferation with dual regulation through epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) signaling and keap1 interactions.39 in cells with the keap1 gene mutation ( a549 cells ) , activated nrf2 promotes cell proliferation independent of egfr signaling . \\n therefore , egfr tyrosine - kinase inhibitors are intrinsically ineffective in these types of non - small cell lung cancer.39 cancer metastasis and tumor progression requires the epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) and the loss of e - cadherin is considered to be a main event in emt . in hek293 cells , complex of e - cadherin and beta - catenin could bind to c - terminus of nrf2 preventing nuclear translocation of nrf2.47 as e - cadherin inhibits nrf2-mediated transcription , loss of e - cadherin could promote nrf2 translocation and confer an additional survival advantage to cancer cells.47 the keap1-nrf2 pathway is involved in the inhibition of apoptosis by interacting with p53 and b cell lymphoma-2 ( bcl-2 ) . \\n p53 inhibits the activation of nrf2 target genes by direct interacting with are - containing promoters or activating p21.21 considering that p53-induced apoptosis requires the accumulation of ros , increased activity of antioxidant genes by nrf2 in cancer cells can inhibit p53 dependent apoptosis . \\n bcl-2 can repress cell death by dimerization with bcl-2-associated x protein ( bax ) and the bcl-2 homology 2 ( bh2 ) domain of bcl-2 is required for this heterodimerization.48 it was found that keap1 binds to the bh2 domain and facilitates the ubiquitination of bcl-2 leading , to bax accumulation and enhanced apoptosis . \\n thus , mutations in the keap1 binding site for bcl2 are responsible for the anti - apoptotic effect as well as overexpression of nrf2.49 moreover , it has been reported that nrf2 can directly activate the transcription of bcl-2 and bcl - xl.50,51 many studies have reported the association between nrf2 upregulation and chemoresistance in various cancers , including gastric cancer , osteosarcoma , non - small cell lung cancer , endometrial cancer , bladder cancer , and neuroblastoma.2427,52 platinum drugs generate electrophilic molecules that damage cancer cells . \\n chemoresistance to these drugs can be explained by high expression of antioxidant nrf2 target genes.4 another mechanism of chemoresistance is the induction of the drug efflux pump family , which includes the mdr , by nrf2.53 some drugs , including hdac inhibitors , oxaliplatin , and proteasome inhibitors can induce nrf2 and thus decrease the effectiveness of chemotherapy.5456 \\n in light of the data presented in this review , nrf2 is an attractive molecular target for the inhibition of cancer . \\n in contrast to nrf2 activators , including numerous phytochemicals , only a small number of nrf2 inhibitors have been identified ( table ) . \\n trigonelline , a coffee alkaloid , efficiently decreased basal and tertiary butylhydroquinone ( tbhq)-induced nrf2 activity in chemoresistant pancreatic carcinoma cell lines ( panc1 , colo357 , and miapaca2 ) which have high nrf2 activity . along with inhibiting nrf2 \\n the sensitivity of all cell lines to anticancer drugs and tumor necrosis factor - related apoptosis inducing ligand ( trail)-induced apoptosis was enhanced by trigonelline.57 chrysin ( 5,7-dihydroxyflavone ) is a natural flavonoid that is found in many plant extracts . in doxorubicin \\n resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cell line ( bel-7402/adm ) , chrysin significantly reduced nrf2 expression by downregulating the pi3k - akt and erk pathways.58 in that study , chrysin restored chemosensitivity by downregulating the nrf2-downstream genes such as ho-1 , akr1b10 , and mrp5 . \\n apigenin ( 4,5,7-trihydroxyflavone ) is a natural flavone that is present in many fruits and vegetables and has various biological activities , such as anti - inflammatory and antioxidant properties . in a study \\n using bel-7402/adm cell lines , apigenin reduced nrf2 expression as well as the expression of nrf2-downstream genes . \\n when cells were treated with doxorubicin , apigenin showed a synergistic anti - tumor effect on bel-7402/adm cell lines , resulting in reduced cell proliferation and more substantially induced apoptosis.59 brusatol is a quassinoid that is extracted from brucea javanica . \\n brusatol reduced nrf-2 protein level without changing the keap1 level and sensitized various cells including hela , mda - mb-231 , and a549 to chemotherapeutic agents such as carboplatin , 5-fluorouracil , etoposide , and paclitaxel.60 the anticancer effect of brustalol mediated by nrf2 was confirmed in a xenograft model indicating that brusatol could be used to combat intrinsic resistance . \\n ascorbic acid is an antioxidant that can suppress the level of nrf2 . in the imatinib - resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line kcl22/sr , \\n binding of nrf2 to the are of the gamma - glutamylcysteine synthetase gene promoter was much stronger than in the parental imatinib - sensitive cell line kcl22.61 furthermore , addition of ascorbic acid to kcl22/sr cells resulted in a decrease in nrf2-dna binding and partial restoration of imatinib sensitivity to kcl22/sr.61 luteolin ( 3,4,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone ) is a polyphenolic flavonoid found in high concentrations in celery , green pepper , and parsley . in a study using a cell - based are - reporter assay , \\n luteolin was found to be a potent nrf2 inhibitor.62 in that study , luteolin significantly sensitized a549 cells to the anticancer drugs oxaliplatin , bleomycin , and doxorubicin indicating the potential application of luteolin as a natural sensitizer in chemotherapy . \\n constitutively expressed nrf2 can promote cancer cell proliferation and protect cells against oxidative stress and therapeutic agents . \\n it must be kept in mind that chemopreventive agents including various phytochemicals can induce chemoresistance and tumor progression by activating the keap1-nrf2 pathway . \\n however , it will be necessary to understand the molecular regulation of nrf2 and identifying the individualized status of nrf2 expression .', 'a 3-year - old male , known to have isolated speech delay ,

was shown that the rate of acute renal failure in the pediatric patients with rhabdomyolysis ranged from 5% to 8.7% . \\n the risk factors that predispose a patient with rhabdomyolysis for developing acute renal injury are creatine kinase level concentration more than 5000 u / l , creatine kinase value upon admission , and slower decline in the serum creatine kinase level . \\n other factors include high myoglobin level , persistent or abrupt increase in the potassium or calcium level , as well as persistent metabolic acidosis . \\n on the other hand , a recent study by fernandez et al showed that the most reliable predictor of acute renal failure and the need for dialysis is the creatinine level above 1.7 , despite the peak creatine kinase . \\n the mainstay for the prevention and treatment of acute kidney injury is early and aggressive volume resuscitation . \\n other management options include alkalization of the urine , forced diuresis with mannitol , and loop diuretics . in

could be the first presentation of lipin-1 mutation that causes recurrent rhabdomyolysis in children . \\n lipin-1 gene encodes the muscle - specific phosphatidic acid phosphatase , a key enzyme in triglyceride and membrane phospholipid biosynthesis . \\n the episodes of rhabdomyolysis are mostly triggered by intercurrent infections and fever and to a lesser extent by fasting or exercise . \\n

glass and metal works , foundries , rolling mills , in the vicinity of hardening furnaces , rotary kilns in the cement industry , high - temperature laboratory furnaces , as well as firefighting , are associated , in addition to common mechanical hazards ( e.g. , due to splashes of molten metals and slag ) , sparks and direct contact with open fires , with hazards caused by emission of harmful optic radiation within the visible ( vis ) and infrared ( ir ) spectrum range . \\n excessive exposure to ir radiation leads to dryness of the mucous membranes , burns of the eyeball and development of cataracts . \\n protection against thermal hazards due to excessive amounts of ir radiation reaching the eyes is provided by protective optic filters installed in spectacles , goggles or face protections . besides protecting the user against hazardous ir radiation \\n , such filters should ensure that the object / area of work can be seen clearly . if the level of ir radiation is very high , \\n the use of filters reflecting radiation is recommended , as it allows the temperature increase in the filter itself to be reduced . \\n the filters currently used for the protection of the face and eyes against hazardous ir radiation are of metallic reflective type , made of glass or organic material ( mainly polycarbonate ) bases coated with a single metallic layer for reflectance of ir radiation or absorption filters . \\n absorption filters are manufactured from dyed glass obtained in a mass staining process by introduction of a factor modifying the radiation within the vis and near infrared ( nir ) spectrum range passing through the filter . \\n the effect of a protective optical filter obtained as a result of this process is based on absorption of a large proportion of optic radiation , whereas only a small proportion of radiation the filter is exposed to is reflected . \\n this is an undesirable phenomenon , contributing to deterioration of the filter user 's comfort . \\n reflective metallic filters are obtained by deposition of a metallic layer of copper ( cu ) or gold ( au ) on mineral or organic bases . \\n such filters take advantage of the characteristic properties of the metals used in their production , i.e. , significant reflection coefficient for ir radiation and significant transmittance for the vis spectrum . despite the fact that the technique of deposition of interference layers has been known for many years   the application of thin film ir filters in eye protections to block \\n the previous papers published by the authors of this study   contain descriptions of the structure of interference filters designed for application in eye protections \\n highly effective in reduction of ir radiation with high level of transmission of the vis spectrum . \\n the authors investigated also the optical and mechanical parameters of the newly developed protective optic filters manufactured with the use of interference technologies . \\n the analysis of the results of the conducted tests demonstrated numerous advantages of interference technology application in the construction of protective filters , including : improved resistance to damage of the external protective filter surface ( cracking , scratching etc . ) as well as high reflection coefficients for the nir spectrum . \\n the aim of the present study was to compare the optic properties of protective filters manufactured by taking advantage of the interference technology and those coated with a single metallic layer reflecting ir radiation . \\n the coefficients characterizing their optic parameters , allowing to assess the protective properties within the vis and ir spectrum range were compared . \\n the following coefficients were analysed

is determined on the basis of luminous transmittance ( the higher protection level correlates with the higher level of ir radiation blocked and appropriately lower vis light transmittance ) . \\n protection level consists of a code number ( e.g. , 4 ) for ir filters and a shade number ( e.g. , 3 , 5 , 7 ) calculated according to the following equation : \\n ( 1 ) \\n where  \\n v \\n =

range passes through the anterior compartment of the eye , the lens and reaches the retina . exposure to an excessive amount of radiation from this range \\n can result in burns of the retina and , in extreme cases , its permanent damage . \\n , chronic long - term exposure may lead to the development of cataracts , referred to as ir or glass worker 's cataracts . in view of the above \\n the results presented on the graphs in figure 1 and the determined transmittance values ( see table 2 ) indicate unequivocally more effective blocking of ir radiation provided by interference filters . \\n the values of  \\n a and  \\n n for interference filters are lower even by an order of magnitude than those obtained for the metallic reflective filters . \\n for instance , the mean value of ir transmittance within the 7802000  nm range for interference filters with protection level 4 - 5 ( one of the most common protection levels used in the metallurgic industry ) equals 0.006% and is significantly lower than the maximum acceptable value specified in , which is 10.6% . \\n for all the investigated filters , the values of r \\n n exceed 60% , which classifies them in the group of filters with increased ir reflectance . \\n the levels of the ir absorptance for metallic reflective filters and interference filters of 4 - 3 and 4 - 5 protection class are similar . for the highest of the investigated protection levels  4 - 7 \\n the above findings are important for selection of a filter appropriate for the radiation source . \\n the selection of filter protection level is dependent on the temperature of the radiation source . \\n the 4 - 7 level is used for radiation sources whose temperature exceeds 1600  k ( e.g. , occurs in the metallurgical industry ) . with such high temperatures , \\n reduction of filter heating as a result of exposure to ir radiation is important . as it follows from comparative analysis of the optic properties of filters taking advantage of the interference technology and filters coated with a single metallic layer reflecting ir radiation \\n , the interference filters provide a more effective blocking of ir radiation in comparison with the currently used protective filters . \\n \", \"twenty - two workers were followed up from 15th april to 30th april 2008 during working hours , from approximately 6 am to 3 pm , for a total of

preventable morbidity worldwide ( 1 ) and although human beings possess considerable ability to compensate for naturally occurring heat stress , many occupational environments and/or physical activities expose workers to heat loads which are so excessive as to threaten their health and productivity ( 11 ) . \\n it is important to remember that the normal human body contains approximately

this study , important results were obtained . \\n other authors have shown the relationship between heat stress health effects and the ability to perform different tasks , as well as the increased risk of suffering work - related injuries ( 14 ) . in this study , the workers drank more liquid as temperature values increased to maximum peaks . \\n this was part of a rehydration process which was well planned in advance by the company 's decision makers . unlike during past harvesting seasons , when water and rehydration solutions were distributed quite randomly , during this harvesting season cool water and specially formulated drinks were distributed or intended to be distributed to workers , who received 1 l just before they began their working day and then 500 ml every 30 minutes . \\n the basis of this principle is that drinking to satisfy thirst is not enough to keep a person well hydrated . \\n most of the people become aware of thirst once they have lost 12 l of body water and persons highly motivated to perform hard work may incur losses of 34 l before serious thirst forces them to stop and drink . \\n since dehydration reduces the capacity for absorption from the gut , workers must be educated regarding the importance of drinking enough water during work and continuing generous rehydration during off - duty hours ( 14 ) . \\n there was a significant increase of production , with up to 8 tons per worker during the follow - up period compared to the normal 5.5 tons per worker prior to the change in rehydration measures . \\n this important change in rehydration policies and increase in production output is the result of various efforts of training workers , foremen and managers on heat stress prevention , proper hydration measures and quality of ( working ) life carried out by occupational health and safety professionals ( physicians and engineers ) , human resources departments and top management at sugarcane farms . \\n . often workers rejected the new rehydration measures , most of the time because it was difficult for them to understand thoroughly the dehydration and physiological compensatory mechanisms . \\n some of the reasons for this can be attributed to their low educational level , and feeling that  nothing bad has ever happened to me before , etc . \\n certainly more effort in terms of intervention strategies and scientific investigation needs to be carried out among workers in nicaragua who perform jobs in which they are exposed to high ambient temperatures . \\n these include farm workers , construction workers , miners and fishermen , especially those employed in the informal sector , which occupies about half of nicaragua 's economically active population . \\n more funds should also be designated by companies decision makers for improving basic working conditions , in order to increase overall productivity ( and workers satisfaction in terms of better wages ) . \\n this would also translate into safer and healthier workers , less absenteeism from sick leave , fewer accidents and other incidents . \\n the author has not received any funding or benefits from industry to conduct this study .\", 'choroid plexus papilloma ( cpp ) is a rare benign tumor accounting for 0.5% of all intracranial tumors that is more common in childhood , consisting of 1.5 to 6.4% of pediatric intracranial tumors.1 \\n 2 the majority of cpps occur during the first 2 years of life , with 12.5 to 20% ( 10 to 12% ) reported in infants under 1  year of age.1 \\n 3 there have been some reports of  calcified cpp ,   cpp in an adult , \\n cpp in the cerebellopontine angle ( cpa ) ,  and  atypical form of cpp.4 \\n 5 \\n 6 \\n 7 however , a case combining with these four features  adult , dense calcification , atypical form , and cpa  is considered to be extremely rare ; such a case has never been encountered among the 8,540 skull base tumors on which the senior author ( t.f . ) has operated in the past 20 years . \\n we report an adult case of densely calcified , atypical cpp originated from the cpa without connection to the forth ventricle . \\n a 41-year - old man presented with a chief complaint of headache , dizziness , and difficulty with gait that had been gradually worsening for 8 months . \\n neurological examination revealed blurred vision , nystagmus with lateral gaze , and mild right facial weakness . \\n intermittent difficulty with balance and gait were also present ; however , no motor weakness was observed . \\n computed tomography ( ct ) of the head without contrast revealed a high - density multilobular mass in the right cpa causing mass effect and slight ventricular enlargement ( fig . \\n magnetic resonance ( mr ) images demonstrated a trilobed solid mass that measured 4.1 cm in maximum diameter ( fig . \\n the mass was extra - axial in location and revealed isointensity on both t1-weighted images ( t1-wi ) and t2-weighted images ( t2-wi ) . \\n ct and mr images did not reveal any connection between the tumor and the fourth ventricle . \\n the surface of the tumor was roughly irregular and looked grayish pink . since the tumor was friable , gelatinous , vascular , and adherent to surrounding structures , it was hard to separate from cranial nerves . \\n cranial nerves vi , vii , viii , ix , and x were enveloped in the tumor mass , which included calcification . \\n the patient was discharged after recovery from the dysphagia by appropriate rehabilitation . \\n computed tomography without contrast revealed a high - density multilobular mass in the right cerebellopontine angle . \\n magnetic resonance images demonstrated a trilobed solid mass that was in an extra - axial location . \\n the tumor revealed isointensity on both t1-weighted images ( upper left ) and t2-weighted images ( upper right ) . \\n homogeneous intense enhancement was identified ( axial in lower left , sagittal in lower right ) . \\n cpp reported in this article primarily occurred in the cpa with close proximity to the foramen of luschka lacking continuity of the fourth ventricle . \\n the majority of choroid plexus tumors ( cpts ) originate in the ventricular system , 43 to 67% in the lateral ventricle , 24 to 39% in the fourth ventricle , and 9.5 to 11% in the third ventricle , respectively.8 \\n 9 the common site of origin differs in each pediatric and adult group . in the pediatric age group , \\n 60 to 80% of such tumors occur in the lateral ventricle , especially in the trigone , because the vascular stalk of the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricle is usually attached to the inferior portion of the trigone . on the other hand , \\n most cpp in adults occurs within the fourth ventricle.9 \\n 10 \\n 11 a small number of the tumors have been reported to be located in extraventricular regions , the cpa , or the cerebellar hemisphere or the suprasellar cistern.8 \\n 10 \\n 12 cpp within the cpa was first described by cushing in 1917.13 to date , cpp within the cpa has been reported in 7 to 9% of all cpts and is most exclusively found in adults.9 \\n 11 \\n 14 \\n 15 it is divided into two categories according to the origin of the tumor ; one is primary extraventricular cpts and the other is a result of a direct extension of fourth ventricular tumors through the foramen of luschka.15 because the tumor of our case revealed no connection from the fourth ventricle , it is considered to originate from small choroid tufts that normally project from each recess at the foramen luschka into the cpa or from ectopic choroidal islets  unconnected  with the choroid plexus.16 \\n  the cpp of our case indicated dense calcification with ventricular enlargement . \\n the bulbous tufts extended from the fourth ventricular choroid plexus through the foramen of luschka have been known as the bochdalek flower basket , which could be identified in 75% on ct and 96% on mr imaging.17 calcification of the region was found in 38% on normal imaging anatomy.17 in pathological states , calcification of cpp was reported in 4.1% on plain skull radiographs and 23.8% on ct examinations in patients of all \\n 9 the feature of the calcification was commonly described as a stippled or patchy configuration that may include some degrees of hemorrhage.8 \\n 9 \\n 10 dense calcification was exceptionally reported by sarkar et al.2 the rate of hydrocephalus in association with cpp is 90% and the rate increases up to 100% in malignant cpps.8 the cause of hydrocephalus was considered a combination of cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) overproduction ( four to five times that in healthy persons ) , obstruction of csf pathways by the tumor mass , impaired csf absorption , increased protein content of csf around the tumor , subarachnoid scarring or granulations related to recurrent bleeding from the tumor , elevated intraventricular pulse pressure , and adhesions around the exit foramina of the fourth ventricle caused by highly proteinaceous or hemorrhagic csf.2 \\n 10 \\n 18 the finding of tumor calcification in the cpa generally required consideration of differential diagnosis with papillary or psammomatous meningioma , melanotic schwannoma , and myxopapillary ependymoma . among these tumors , \\n association of ventricular enlargement with the finding of calcification might suggest the possible presence of cpts . \\n gross total removal was performed in our case of atypical cpp , although the tumor adhered to adjacent structures . in the 2007 world health organization classification of tumors of the central nervous system \\n , cpts are classified into cpp as grade i , atypical cpp as grade ii , and choroid plexus carcinoma ( cpc ) as grade iii . among cpts , \\n total removal of cpts is recommended and seems to be feasible since a significant prognostic factor was relevant to the extent of tumor removal , and no definitive evidence of the beneficial effect of radiotherapy has been reported6 \\n 18 \\n 19 \\n 20 . however , it is not always possible because of tumor bleeding and firm adhesion to adjacent structures , especially cranial nerves . \\n the rate of complete resection of benign cpp was 80% and the 5-year survival rate indicated is nearly 100% . \\n the majority of survivors are neurologically intact.19 because of the good prognosis , the preservation of cranial nerve functions should be primarily considered in surgery for benign cpp . as for the atypical cpp \\n , the rate of total removal was decreased to 50 from 63%.11 \\n 21 atypical cpp showed a recurrence rate of 29% , which was much higher than the 6% seen in cpp . \\n in addition , seeding within the central nervous system , spontaneous pulmonary metastasis , or rapid regrowth of atypical cpp were also reported.7 \\n 22 \\n 23 total or gross total removal should be advocated , especially in malignant cpts even though the tumor encases the cranial nerves . \\n the finding of calcification in the cpa should suggest the possible presence of cpp , especially if ventricular enlargement is present .', \"jaw cysts are usually painless , but they can increase in size as they absorb neighboring structures . \\n enucleation generally induces bone regeneration within a cystic lesion less than 3 cm in diameter and eliminates the lesion ; however , it is difficult to postoperatively predict lesion recurrence and bone regeneration in cases of larger cysts . for this reason \\n , a surgeon can choose between conservative and aggressive treatments for a large , aggressive , cystic tumor12 . \\n it has been reported that marsupialization and decompression , both of which are conservative treatments that create an opening to reduce pressure within a cystic cavity and induce bone formation , generate few postoperative complications and produce great therapeutic effects3456 . \\n these procedures not only provide good surgical access to smaller lesions , but they also preserve intraoral tissues , maintain pulp vitality , and reduce recurrence rates . for this reason , many surgeons prefer these methods for treating large cysts . this study aimed to analyze and assess the therapeutic effects of decompression for patients who underwent decompression followed by enucleation . \\n we reviewed the charts of patients who visited the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery at chosun university dental hospital ( gwangju , korea ) and who had undergone enucleation after decompression . \\n we collected data on their age and gender , location and size of the lesions , preoperative and postoperative histopathological findings , gap in time between decompression and enucleation , and variation in the size of the lesions , complications , and

they had been observed for less than six months after enucleation . \\n we measured the sizes of lesions in pre- and post - decompression panoramic photographs for each patient , measured width and length with a caliper , and multiplied them together to determine the lesion index ( li ) with the aim of simplifying measurement of irregularly sized lesions . to determine the efficacy of

. \\n in total , 17 patients ( 7 males and 10 females ) were reviewed , and their average age was 33.1 years ( range , 13 - 76 years ) . \\n one patient was diagnosed with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome ( nbccs ) and showed multiple keratocystic odontogenic tumors ( kcot ) in the maxilla and mandible . \\n two of these cysts were treated with marsupialization.(table 1 ) jaw cysts were observed in 10 patients ( 58.8% ) in their teens or 20s , which was a higher rate compared to other age groups , and the sex ratio was 1:1.4 with seven males ( 41.2% ) and 10 females ( 58.8%).(fig . \\n 2 ) radiographic results showed that all lesions were unilocular and were either pushing or intruding into the surrounding structures ( maxillary sinus or mandibular canal ) in 15 patients ( 88.2% ) . based on the results of the histopathologic examination , 10 patients were diagnosed with kcot ( 58.8% ) , five patients with dentigerous cysts ( dc ) ( 29.4% ) , one patient with radicular cyst ( rc ) ( 5.9% ) , and one patient with nasopalatine duct cyst ( 5.9% ) . \\n only one patient ( 5.9% ) was treated with marsupialization only , and 16 patients ( 94.1% ) were treated with marsupialization followed by enucleation . there was no case where the preoperative histopathologic results changed after the operation . \\n the average time of decompression was 8.13.4 months , with 5.54.8 months for a cyst in the mandible and 8.33.1 months for the maxilla . \\n the average time of decompression based on lesion type was 8.83.2 months for kcot and 6.02.7 months for dc , suggesting that kcots require approximately three more months of treatment . \\n the li was measured at an average of 1,349 mm before decompression and 463 mm after decompression , showing an average size decrease of 64% after decompression . \\n according to nakamura 's formula , five patients ( 29.4% ) showed a greater than 80% decrease in size , nine patients ( 52.9% ) showed a 50%-80% decrease in size , and three patients ( 17.6% ) showed a less than 50% decrease in size.(fig . \\n 3 ) the mandible decreased by 10% more in size than the maxilla , and it had a 1.7-fold higher reduction rate in the same period . also , when comparing size reduction based on patient age , the decrease was greater in patients in their teens or 20s compared to the other age groups , but the reduction rates were not significantly different . \\n males were observed to have a smaller final lesion size , while the reduction ratio was higher in females ; however , no significant differences were observed . \\n additionally , larger lesions reduced faster that smaller ones , and kcots showed more positive results for decompression than other lesion types.(table 2 ) one patient 's recovery was complicated by hypoesthesia after marsupialization , but this naturally recovered over time . \\n the total follow - up period was 1 to 8 years , and 3 out of 17 patients were suspected recurrence . \\n however , one patient was diagnosed with scar tissue after re - examination , and one patient was diagnosed with periapical cyst due to re - infection of an incomplete root canal treatment . \\n a true recurrence appeared on one nbccs patient 's left maxilla and is currently being followed - up after re - operation . \\n since decompression was introduced as a conservative treatment for odontogenic cyst , many cases have been treated with decompression , and various studies have reported high success rates89 . however , the reaction varies depending on the cyst . \\n anavi et al.10 conducted decompression on 57 patients who were diagnosed with kcot , dc , or rc , and no statistically significant differences in reduction rate were reported based on the histologic diagnosis . in present study , \\n the reduction rate in kcot was higher than the other cysts , with an average of 131.84 mm / month , with the final reduction being the highest . \\n this is because kcots are aggressive , so the size of the lesion tends to be greater than that of other cystic lesions . according to this study , cases of li larger than 1,000 mm showed twice the sensitivity of li smaller than 1,000 mm . \\n therefore , in this study , kcot patients seemed to have a higher sensitivity to decompression since the li was larger than 1,000 mm . \\n there are no formal criteria for the decompression period or change in size ; however , according to previous studies , a 65% reduction was reported when maintained for an average of 8.4 months . \\n additionally , an 81% reduction was observed when decompression was maintained for an average of 17.5 months911 . \\n another study reported that it is preferable to perform enucleation if the size of the lesion after decompression decreases more than 50%-60%8 . in this study , the average decompression period was 8.1 months , and the lesions showed an average reduction of 64% . \\n the effects of decompression based on age are controversial , as it was reported that younger patients had higher reduction rates10 , but it also was reported that decompression is not correlated with age12 . \\n therefore , even at older ages , if a large cystic lesion exists within the jaw , postoperative complications can be reduced by decreasing size via decompression . \\n brndum and jensen13 performed enucleation after decompression in 12 patients with kcot ; during 7 to 17 years of follow - up , no recurrence was reported . \\n such low recurrence rates were reported in many studies , and some of them reported biopsy results indicating that the histological characteristics of the residual cyst epithelium changed from parakeratinization to orthokeratinization or were no longer observed14 . \\n based on these results , august et al.11 reported that histological changes are likely to appear when decompression is maintained for longer than nine months , and he proposed a decompression period of at least nine months . \\n this study used a panoramic radiograph to two - dimensionally evaluate the lesion by measuring the maximum vertical and horizontal widths of the lesion . \\n this method is widely used because of ease , but it has a disadvantage in accuracy , as it two - dimensionally evaluates a three - dimensional lesion . \\n therefore , a recent method of measuring volume via three - dimensional analysis using a computer program was introduced15 . \\n however , this method requires a special program and skilled technique , so it can be difficult to apply clinically . although plane analysis was performed in the present study due to lack of data for three - dimensional analysis , a more accurate analysis is expected once sufficient data is obtained . \\n this study was limited in that statistical analysis was not performed due to lack of samples . \\n thus , when a lesion is large , reducing its size via decompression not only allows for conservative treatment , but it can also minimize complications . \\n according to this study , all patients treated with decompression were reported to have shown a reduction in lesion size and higher sensitivity with a larger lesion size . \\n there was no difference in the effect of decompression based on age , and only one patient experienced recurrence of the cyst .\", 'osseointegrated implants are a practical alternative to traditional prosthodontics ; however , designing an implant - supported prosthesis with function and esthetics is a challenge . \\n malaligned implants often complicate the clinical laboratory procedures employed for fabrication of superstructures . due to improper load distribution , \\n a stent is an appliance used for radiographic evaluation of height and width of the available bone during treatment planning for implant placement or during surgical procedures to provide site for optimum implant placement . \\n the variable type of stents includes vaccuform or acrylic resin templates adapted over duplicated casts of diagnostic wax - up . \\n these include plastic or metal tubes and channels in acrylic resin that dictate the position of implants . \\n stents should be made of transparent material , stable and rigid when in position , should cover enough teeth to stabilize its position , and when no teeth are present , stents should extend onto unreflected soft tissue regions . with the use of computed tomography ( ct ) and computer added designing ( cad)/ computer added machining ( cam ) technology \\n , it is now possible to construct a surgical implant stent that would allow the clinician to predetermine implant locations virtually and surgically place them without reflecting a tissue flap.[58 ] but the surgical stents prepared with ct and cad / cam technology are very much more cost effective than a conventional surgical stent and require enough time and special center and/or laboratories for their fabrication and later on their correction , if required . in this study \\n , we used the conventional surgical stents to evaluate their efficacy in determining the position and diameter of implants . \\n the aim of the study was to demonstrate the accuracy and clinical precision of conventional surgical stent protocol for optimum installation of dental implants in terms of position and diameter . \\n the aim of the study was to demonstrate the accuracy and

of prosthodontics and dental material sciences in collaboration with department of oral and maxillofacial surgery , faculty of dental sciences , csmmu , lucknow . \\n patients were treated in this study with the conventional surgical stents ; all the implants were placed to the desired depth as planned in virtual implant planning . \\n all the patients ( 45 patients for whom 89 implants were placed at different sites ) [ figures 1 , 2 ] visiting the department of prosthodontics and oral and maxillofacial surgery for implant supported prosthesis placement and who followed the standard inclusion criteria for placement of implants were included in the study . \\n first of all , diagnostic cast of the patients was made and acrylic teeth / tooth were waxed - up [ figure 3 ] . then , the impression of that waxed - up cast was taken and poured to reproduce another cast with the missing teeth / tooth replaced by dental stone . \\n then , mesiodistal and buccolingual markings were drawn over these teeth / tooth to find a center point on the occlusal surface [ figure 4 ] . \\n later on , after applying the separating media over these regions and filling the undercuts with wax , transparent self - curing material was applied at the teeth to be replaced along with some adjacent area antero - posteriorly , which confers the stability to the stent during implant placement [ figure 5 ] . \\n the holes were drilled in the stent so formed at the center point for the assessment of the diameter and position of implant and filled with gutta percha [ figure 6 ] . \\n this stent was placed in the mouth and radiograph was taken to evaluate the position of gutta percha . \\n the efficacy of stents was then evaluated at the time of surgical exposure for implant placement and after the surgery , with the help of radiographs [ figures 7 , 8 ] . \\n intraoral view of the patient radiograph of the patients waxed - up missing teeth missing teeth replaced by dental stone in the

simplicity , precise accuracy and low cost . \\n it can be fabricated with minimum laboratory procedures which are used in routine dental practice . \\n on the other hand , the fixed type screw retained implant stents which are fabricated with the help of ct and cad / cam technology are very costly and require more time and laboratory procedures . \\n the stents fabricated with the radiopaque markers provide radiographic as well as clinical ease for optimum implant installation . along with all these advantages \\n the drill holes can directly be made through the stent , so the implant surgery may become less traumatic ( with the preservation of soft tissue including the gingival margins of adjacent teeth and the interdental papilla ) with decreased operative time which results in accelerated post - surgical healing , fewer post - operative complications and increased comfort and satisfaction for the patient . \\n the possibility of displacement of stent during implant surgery was minimized by extension of the stent antero - posteriorly to cover enough area over the teeth / tooth present adjacent to edentulous area . in cases where no teeth are present , \\n stabilization of stent was achieved by extending it over the unreflected areas like retromolar regions . \\n this study shows the extreme accuracy of this conventional surgical stent . if each step of this protocol is followed precisely , it is possible to deliver an optimum implant installation in terms of position and diameter and later on function at a very much reduced rate and time , as taken

numerous estimations , 15% to 29% of patients with cataract have 1.5 diopters ( d ) of refractive astigmatism.1,2 cataract surgeons usually prefer to treat cataract and correct refractive ( spherical and astigmatic ) disorders at the time of the surgery . \\n corneal incision ( astigmatic keratotomy ) and peripheral corneal relaxing incisions ( pcris ) were performed to treat these disorders.3,4 the main drawbacks of these approaches are that the outcome depends on multiple factors as the patient s age , the depth and length of the incision , complications related to wound healing , epithelial defects , or induction of dry - eye symptoms . \\n these parameters affect the visual outcome in a unpredictable way so the corneal incisions are not considered a reliable method for astigmatism correction . \\n toric intraocular lens ( iols ) implantation was introduced in the 1990 s as an option for astigmatism correction in cataract patients . \\n initially they presented the disadvantage of postoperative rotation that decreased the visual outcome.58 new toric iol designs ( acrysof   toric iol ; alcon , fort worth , tx ) , approved by the us food and drug administration ( fda ) at the end of 2005 , have been found to be more stable and appear to be the preferred iol for correcting preexisting astigmatism in conjunction with cataract surgery.9,10 the acrysof   iols are available in three options : t3 , t4 , and t5 of astigmatic correction 1.5 , 2.25 , 3.00 d , respectively ( at the iol plane ) . \\n the aim of this study is to report the clinical results of acrysof   toric iols implantation for preexisting astigmatism correction and compare the postoperative rotation of the iols one and six months postoperatively . \\n this prospective study included eyes that had cataract surgery at the papageorgiou general hospital , thessaloniki , greece , between may 2008 and december 2008 . \\n the study was conducted according to the tenets of the declaration of helsinki and patients gave informed consent after the nature and intent of the study had been fully explained to them . \\n inclusion criteria were : cataract , age 70 years or younger , and preoperative regular corneal astigmatism greater than 1.00 d. exclusion criteria were : glaucoma , corneal disease , previous corneal or intraocular surgery , macular degeneration or retinopathy , and history of ocular inflammation . \\n each patient had a complete ophthalmologic examination , including visual acuity ( va ) , slit - lamp examination , intraocular pressure ( iop ) measurement , and dilated fundus examination . \\n topography ( magellan mapper ; nidek technologies , padova , italy ) , automated refractometry ( rk600 ; reichert , inc . \\n , depew , ny ) , and ultrasonic immersion biometry ( ocuscan rxp ; alcon ) were performed to determine the appropriate iol spherical power . \\n cylindrical power and axis placement to achieve emmetropia were calculated using an online toric iol calculator program ( available from http://www.acrysoforiccalculator.com/ ) . \\n the 0180 axis was marked with the patient in a sitting position to avoid cyclotorsion using the nuijts / lane preoperative toric reference corneal marker ( ae-2791tbl ; asico , westmont , il ) ( figure 1 ) . \\n intraoperatively , the desired implantation axis was marked using an intra - op toric axis marker ii ( ae-2794 ; asico ) ( figure 2 ) . \\n a foldable iol was implanted in the capsular bag through a 2.75 mm limbal incision on 110. the toric iol was injected with a monarch - ii injector ( alcon ) and placed around 1015 off axis before the ophthalmic viscosurgical device ( sodium hyaluronate 1% ) was removed . \\n after ophthalmic viscosurgical device removal , the iol was rotated to its final position by exactly aligning the toric reference marks with the limbal implantation axis marks . \\n all surgeries were performed by the same experienced surgeon ( it ) using topical anesthesia and a standard divide - and - conquer phacoemulsification technique . because of the intraoperative marker design and the pen mark fading during the operation in several cases , it was difficult to assess the proper alignment of the iol after its placement . because of this difficulty , an image was captured from the real - time streaming recording of the surgery and was assessed blindly by a second operator using a commercially available software ( screen protractor ; iconico , ny , usa ) ( unpublished data ) . to overcome this difficulty we consider that the use of the marker set consisting of beveled degree gauge ( ae-1590 ; asico ) and maloney astigmatism axis marker ( ae-2741 ; asico ) is more appropriate for the whole procedure because it allows maximum visibility . \\n the on - screen assessment of the axis remains a useful tool for postoperative evaluation of the iol location ( figure 3 ) . \\n measurements of visual acuity ( using the snellen opto - type at a six - meter distance ) , iop , and comprehensive slit lamp examination were performed at one - day and one- and six - month postoperative visits . at the one- and six - month follow - up \\n , a digital photograph and corneal topography ( only at the one - month visit ) were obtained to estimate the postoperative rotation of the iol using the software tools mentioned above ( figure 1 ) . \\n outcomes of interest included uncorrected va , cylindrical astigmatism power before and after iol implantation , and the possible rotation of the iol one and six months after the operation ( when the initial desired place was at 0 ) . \\n absolute values of the rotation used for the analysis after detecting rotation was not under investigation . \\n completed data forms were analyzed with microsoft excel 2007 ( microsoft corporation , redmond , wa ) and spss software ( version 16.0 ; spss inc . , chicago , il ) . \\n twenty - nine eyes of 19 patients ( mean age 63.03  5.42 years ) were enrolled in this study . \\n uncorrected va was found to be 5/10 or more in 26 of 29 eyes ( 89.7% ) and 8/10 or more in 19 of 29 patients ( 65.5% ) . \\n preoperative and postoperative corneal topography showed significant reduction of refractive astigmatism in all eyes after the surgery . \\n mean power of the astigmatism was 2.38  0.91 d ( range 1.55 d ) preoperatively and 0.64  0.61 d ( range 02.5 d ) postoperatively ( figure 4 ) . \\n one month postoperation , the mean toric iol axis rotation was 2.2  1.5 ( range 0.67.8 ) . \\n six months postoperation , the mean toric iol axis rotation was 2.7  1.5 ( range 0.98.4 ) . \\n the later rotation occurred between one and six months , and was found to be more than one degree ( 1.1 ) only in one eye ( 3% ) and in all other cases was less than this value ( figure 5 ) . \\n it is known that one degree of deviation causes 3.3% reduction of the iol cylindrical power . \\n calculated reduction of the desired correction ( in diopters ) because of the observed rotation ( mean value , one and two standard deviations ) for the three iol models is shown in table 1 . \\n no eye had secondary surgery to reposition the iol axis within the six - month postoperative period . \\n the results of our study corroborate previous studies,11 which demonstrates that proper selection and preoperative examination of patients followed by uncomplicated iol implantation of one - piece hydrophobic acrylic toric iols results in acceptable stability and visual outcome . \\n in particular , the postoperative rotation of toric iols appears to occur in the early postoperative period ( 1 month ) and remains constant later than six months . \\n the lens rotates until a fibronectin and collagen adhesion develops between the iol and the posterior capsule , which prevents any further rotary motion.12 the amount of cylindrical correction reduction due to postoperative rotation was not large enough13 to affect the expected end result in final uncorrected distance va . \\n acrysof   one - piece hydrophobic acrylic toric iols implantation shows satisfactory stability , acceptable clinical results , and is an exceptional option for correction of refractive astigmatism .', \"song is a complex , learned motor skill that involves the precise coordination of vocal and respiratory musculature in order to produce highly stereotyped renditions of a memorized song model . \\n two pathways contributed to this behavior are identified in the songbird forebrain : the motor pathway that is required throughout life for normal song production , and the anterior forebrain pathway ( afp ) which is necessary for song learning and plasticity [ 13 ] . \\n hvc ( used as the proper name ) is the beginning nucleus of both pathways and projects to the robust nucleus of the arcopallium ( ra ) and afp . \\n the motor pathway is from hvc to ra , and then ra projects to brainstem nuclei controlling the vocal and respiratory muscles . during song , ra neurons in adult birds generate a highly stereotyped sequence of bursts [ 5 , 6 ] and also receive input from lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium ( lman ) , the output nucleus of afp . \\n notably , recordings from lman neurons projecting to ra revealed highly variable spiking activity across song renditions , suggesting that lman may act as a source of variability . \\n these results indicate that synaptic activity in lman - ra synaptic transmission is crucial to song plasticity [ 8 , 9 ] , but the detailed mechanism is unclear . it has been observed that ra received excitatory glutamatergic inputs from hvc and lman . \\n the former is mediated by a mixture of n - methyl - d - aspartate ( nmda ) and -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic - acid- ( ampa- ) type receptors [ 4 , 10 , 11 ] , and the latter is mediated almost exclusively by nmda - type receptors . \\n lman - ra synaptic transmission is necessary for the variability of song in adult zebra finch , suggesting that the activity of nmda receptor on the lman - ra synapses might induce the activity pattern change of ra neurons and change the bursts that control the vocal and respiratory muscles . \\n the control of gain , which refers to modulation of a neuron 's responsiveness to input , is critically important for normal sensory , cognitive , and motor functions [ 1215 ] . \\n gain control is achieved through a divisive process and is observed as a change in the slope of the input - output relationship . \\n such gain changes are frequently observed in the responses of cortical neurons and are thought to play an important role in neural computations . \\n modulations of gain have been observed in the enhancement of neural responses by attention [ 12 , 16 ] and can also be induced pharmacologically . in a neuron model , \\n nmda receptors caused such membrane potential fluctuations between a hyperpolarized down - state and a depolarized up - state , which may gate the information and gain modulation . \\n here , we test the gain change of ra projection neurons after exogenous nmda was applied to selectively activate nmda receptors , using whole - cell current clamp recording in adult male zebra finch slices . \\n brain slices were prepared from adult male zebra finches ( taeniopygia guttata ) ( > 90 days old ) obtained from commercial suppliers as previously described [ 19 , 20 ] . \\n brains were dissected into ice - cold , oxygenated ( 95% o2 and 5% co2 ) slice solution . \\n slice solution consists of ( in mm ) sucrose 248 , kcl 5 , nahco3   28 , glucose 10 , mgso47h2o 1.3 , and nah2po4h2o 1.26 [ 21 , 22 ] . \\n coronal brain slices ( 250  m thick ) containing ra were cut with a vibrating microtome ( ma752 , usa ) and collected in artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( acsf ) that had been warmed to 37c and subsequently allowed to cool to room temperature . \\n slices were allowed to recover in the holding chamber for at least 1.5  h and were equilibrated to room temperature before recordings were made . \\n standard acsf consists of ( in mm ) nacl 125 , nahco3 25 , nah2po4h2o 1.27 , kcl 2.5 , mgso47h2o 1.2 , cacl2   2.0 , and glucose 25 and was adjusted with sucrose to a final osmolarity of 350  mos . for recording , \\n a slice was transferred to a submerge - type chamber where it was continuously exposed to acsf , saturated with 95% o2 and 5% co2 at room temperature ( 2226c ) at the rate of 2.0  ml / min . \\n ra and the surrounding tissues were distinguishable under bx51wi microscope connected with a dic - ir video camera ( olympus , japan ) . at high magnification ( 40x ) , ra neurons were visualized and the recordings were made from healthy cells . \\n recording pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass ( sutter instruments , usa ) using a flaming - brown puller ( model p-97 , sutter instruments , usa ) and were filled with the pipette solution containing ( in mm ) : k meso4   120 , nacl 5 , hepes 10 , egta 2 , mg - atp 2 , and na3-gtp 0.3 ( ph 7.3 - 7.4 , and 340  mos ) . \\n the recording pipettes , which had resistances ranging from 3 to 5  m , were positioned using an integrated motorized control system ( sutter instruments , usa ) . \\n the potential changes after application of nmda were corrected during the input - output stimulation protocols . \\n the series resistance ( rs ) , between 15  m and 30  m , was compensated using the bridge balance . \\n all agents were applied by changing the bath perfusate from standard acsf to modified acsf in which various drugs were simply added . unless indicated otherwise , \\n the clampfit 9.2 ( axon instruments , usa ) , mini 6.0 ( synaptosoft inc . , fort lee , nj , usa ) , and originpro 8.0 ( originlab , nothampton , ma , usa ) were used for analysis . \\n events with peak amplitude of 50  mv or higher and a rise time of about 0.5  ms were detected automatically , and the results were analyzed with origin pro 8.0 . \\n the steady - state spike rate was estimated by counting the number of spikes in 1 second , and the result was plotted versus the intensity of the injected current ( f - i relationship ) . \\n the slope of the f - i relationship ( referred to as gain ) was estimated by linear fitting . \\n slope parameters were estimated separately for individual neurons and that figures 4 and 5 contain mean slope values averaged for the whole groups of neurons . \\n the amplitude of ahp was quantified as the difference between spike threshold and the lowest point of ahp . throughout \\n means were compared using paired two - tailed student 's t - test or one - way anova followed by scheffe 's multiple comparison . \\n stable whole - cell recordings were obtained in 160  ra projection neurons from 51 adult male zebra finches . \\n a neuron with the resting membrane potential < 50  mv and an overshooting action potential was considered viable . \\n ra projection neuron was identified by a larger soma , time - dependent inward rectifier induced by hyperpolarizing current and spontaneous regular spike firing or by depolarizing current pulses . \\n the input - output relationship was examined by injecting current pulses from 0 to 90  pa with an increment of 10  pa and an interval of 15  s , and they were lasted for 1  s. traces of action potentials in response to 1  s current steps of 10 , 50 , and 90  pa were shown in figure 1(a ) . \\n the slopes of the f - i relationships were 246.92  28.00  hz / na before nmda application and increased to 325.49  73.34 \\n furthermore , the input resistances were decreased by 20  m nmda in ra projection neurons ( p < 0.05 , n = 6 ) ( figure 2 ) . \\n the afterhyperpolarization ( ahp ) of action potential underlies the modulation of firing frequency . to test the effect of nmda on spike ahp \\n comparison of spike shape is shown in figure 3(a ) with 90  pa current injection before and after nmda application . in average \\n , there was no significant change in the amplitude of ahp after nmda application ( p > 0.05 , n = 5 ) ( figure 3(b ) ) . \\n then we used 50  m dl - apv , a nmda receptor antagonist , to check the selectivity of nmda receptor , and we found that the slope of f - i was not changed by dl - apv alone ( p > 0.05 ) . \\n the slope was 255.78  66.69  hz / na and 269.34  56.96  hz / na ( p > 0.05 ) before and after application of 50  m dl - apv ( figure 4 ) , respectively . \\n nmda increased the f - i slope 1.32 times ( p < 0.05 ) ; however , the gain modulation induced by nmda was completely abolished by dl - apv ( figure 4 ) . \\n previous studies reported that ra projection neurons received glutamatergic and gabaergic inputs [ 23 , 24 ] , which might increase background synaptic activities and modulate the gain of neurons [ 25 , 26 ] . to determine the effect of ampa receptor and gaba receptor on gain modulation by nmda , we examined the effects of nmda in the presence of cnqx , an antagonist for ionotropic glutamate ampa receptors , or / and bicuculline methiodide ( bic ) , a competitive antagonist of gabaa receptors , respectively . \\n bic ( 10  m ) accelerated the depolarization by nmda application , but bic alone had little effect on the f - i slope . in the presence of bic , \\n the mean initial slopes were 276.46  59.4 and 332.6  40.02  hz / na before and during application of nmda . \\n the f - i slope was increased from 1.32 to 1.39 in the presence of nmda and bic ( p > 0.05 ) ; that is , there is an increase of 105.30% over the nmda treatment ( figure 5 ; p > 0.05 , unpaired t - test ) . \\n cnqx ( 10  m ) decreased the membrane potential and abolished the spontaneous spikes of ra projection neurons sometimes but did not affect the slope of f - i relationship . in the presence of cnqx , \\n nmda application hardly changed the f - i slope of ra projection neurons no matter whether bic was present or not ( figure 5 ; p > 0.05 ) . \\n these results indicated that the ampa receptor - dependent excitability played a crucial role in the gain modulation by nmda . \\n the slope was 0.97 or 1.11 in the presence of cnqx or cnqx and bic , respectively . \\n the gain induced by nmda was significantly decreased by cnqx ( p < 0.05 ) . \\n in this study , we showed that nmda increased the gain of ra projection neurons in adult zebra finch . \\n nmda - induced gain increase was limited to firing frequencies less than 40  hz . the effect of nmda on gain was mediated through nmda receptors and might involve synaptic activities . in songbirds , we found that nmda increased the slope of f - i relationship in ra projection neurons , which was completely blocked by dl - apv , a nmda receptor selective antagonist , suggesting that nmda increased the sensitivity of ra projection neurons . \\n the pharmacology of nmda receptors involved in gain modulation has been examined in mammals . in cat \\n visual cortex , nmda increased the gain of the contrast - response ( c - r ) curve of the neuron in layers ii / iii and v / vi . in mouse , the thalamocortical neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus play a key role in the generation of firing patterns through nmda receptors . \\n the neural activity in the afp of songbirds can direct moment - by - moment changes in the primary motor areas responsible for generating song . \\n singing - related activity in lman is more variable in pattern across repeated renditions during undirected song than directed song [ 28 , 29 ] . \\n reported that the fundamental frequency of the syllable was shifted by stimulating the lman - ra pathway , which is mediated by nmda receptors . \\n our results indicated that the activity of nmda receptor changed the sensitivity of ra projection neuron . \\n ra , as a premotor nucleus , occupies an important position in the song system , integrating information from both pathways . \\n ra projection neurons are responsible for transmitting song information to midbrain and brainstem vocal and respiratory structures . temporal pattern of spike bursts in ra projection neurons is associated with the timing of acoustic features of birdsong . \\n precise timing of individual spikes has a close relationship with stereotypic behavior , which suggests that the song is represented in ra by a temporal code [ 5 , 31 ] . \\n thus , the modulation of nmda receptors in the activities of ra projection neurons could be very important for the plasticity of birdsong . \\n previous studies in slices demonstrated that nmda receptor achieves the nonlinear , multiplicative behavior seen in gain modulation by several mechanisms . \\n mel presented results from compartmental modeling studies showing that dendrites containing nmda - type synaptic conductances and voltage - dependent na , k , and ca channels can impose nonlinear interactions between nearby synapses that give rise to approximate multiplications [ 32 , 33 ] . in thalamocortical cell of the rat and cat dlgn , nmda receptors contribute to the burst firing generated by the low - threshold ca potential and depend on the membrane potential range over which this type of firing occurs . \\n in substantia nigra dopamine neurons , nmda receptor - mediated synaptic conductance generates transient high - frequency activity by rapidly but transiently overwhelming the conductance 's underlying action potential ahp and/or engaging postsynaptic voltage - dependent ion channels in a manner that overcomes the limiting effects of ahp . \\n but our results showed that there was no significant change in spike ahp after nmda application . \\n so the gain induced by nmda in ra projection neurons may not be mainly modulated by the change of spike shape , but by synaptic activities . \\n the change in membrane potential has been shown to play an important role in the firing pattern regulation by nmda receptor , supporting the idea that depolarization acutely alters firing frequency . \\n it has been shown that simple excitability or inhibition alone can induce a multiplicative gain change in the cortical neurons . in this model , \\n one set of synaptic inputs provided purely excitatory drive to a target neuron , and another set of combined excitatory / inhibitory inputs ( or balanced inputs ) provided the modulation . in this setup , changing the firing rates of the balanced inputs produced an approximately multiplicative gain modulation of the response to the purely excitatory drive . here \\n , blockade of the excitatory or inhibitory transmission alone had no effect on the f - i slope of ra projection neuron , implying that simple excitability or inhibition alone can not induce a multiplicative gain change . \\n however , our results did not exclude a role of spontaneous synaptic activity on gain modulation in vitro , which , due to the loss of synapses in slice , was not sufficient to produce a significant change in gain . \\n ampa receptors are required for the gain modulation in our study , because blocking excitatory transmission mediated by ampa receptors almost abolished the effect of nmda on gain modulation . \\n two reasons might be involved : one is the two states of nmda - base mechanism due to the special anatomical structure of ra . \\n ra projection neurons receive inputs from two areas , hvc and lman . both are excitatory glutamatergic but have distinct postsynaptic properties . \\n hvc - ra is largely mediated by ampa receptor , whereas lman - ra is almost completely mediated by nmda receptor . \\n ampa / nmda receptor composition of different neuronal pathways is the foundation of gating and gain modulation . \\n nmda receptor - rich pathway can gate ampa - rich input and increase the gain of a neuron responding to the input of ampa - rich pathway . \\n the second is related to the intrinsic properties of nmda receptors , which are uniquely voltage dependent . except binding with neurotransmitter \\n blockade of main excitatory inputs mediated by ampa receptor with cnqx hyperpolarized the membrane potential , which caused nmda receptors not activated . \\n therefore , the ampa receptor - mediated excitatory transmission is essential for the gain modulation induced by nmda . \\n it is well known that the nmda receptor plays a critical role in many physiological and pathological processes , such as learning , memory , neurodegeneration , epilepsy , and ischemia . \\n the nmda receptor - mediated synaptic transmission satisfies the associative property of hebbian learning and in fact plays a critical role in its cellular model , long - term synaptic plasticity . \\n nevertheless , pharmacological agents which block nmda receptors impair a variety of brain processes , suggesting that nmda receptor transmission also plays an important role beyond long - term memory and participates in shaping the dynamic activity of neural networks . in song system \\n , the expression pattern of nmda receptor is related to the development of song learning [ 21 , 3740 ] . \\n recent results show that the nmda receptor on the lman - ra synapses generates variability across different song renditions , thereby facilitating reinforced learning of songs . how nmda accomplishes this role is not clear . \\n our results showed that nmda application increased the gain of ra projection neurons , in which ampa receptor was necessary . \\n the ampa receptor - mediated excitability is derived only from hvc [ 10 , 11 ] . \\n therefore , nmda receptor in lman - ra synapse might regulate hvc - ra synaptic transmission , which implicated that nmda receptor is more effective to modulate the syllable online . \\n these findings suggest a mechanism by which nmda receptor can selectively modulate behaviorally relevant excitatory inputs .\", \"first described by veterinarians , pythiosis is a serious life- and limb - threatening infection endemic to thailand , but rarely seen in the western hemisphere . \\n known to infect immunocompetent horses , dogs , and other large animals,2 , 3 \\n pythium infection was first reported in humans in 1989 in association with thalassemic hemoglobinopathy.4 , 5 human pythiosis is known to present in one of four clinical entities : subcutaneous , ocular , vascular , and disseminated . here \\n , we present a unique case of vascular pythiosis managed with limb - sparing vascular bypass grafts complicated by pseudoaneurysm formation . \\n the patient is a 17 year - old jamaican male with a history of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and severe aplastic anemia refractory to horse anti - thymoglobulin treatment , which was transfusion - dependent . \\n one month prior to admission at our institution , he went fishing

three weeks after his initial surgery , the patient developed new sites of pain along the graft site and repeat imaging showed a 2.5  cm pseudoaneurysm at the proximal anastomosis to the external iliac artery with contrast extravasation ( fig . \\n he was taken to the operating room for an extra - anatomic left common iliac artery to the previous femoral popliteal bypass graft using a reverse saphenous vein graft . \\n the patient later developed a polymicrobial superinfection of his wounds , and his vascular repair continued to break down leading to increased ischemic pain . \\n after several multidisciplinary discussions with the family that all medical interventions were exhausted , and that even highly aggressive surgical measures including hip disarticulation or hemipelvectomy could not guarantee source control , conservative measures were initiated and ultimately , the patient expired . \\n this patient presented a major diagnostic challenge , and his disease process and subsequent management were previously unknown to our hospital . \\n in retrospect , he presented with a classic case of vascular pythiosis , with an antecedent history of exposure to surface water and exam findings of vascular insufficiency , including pain out of proportion to exam , distal emboli , and an ischemic ulcer . \\n the correct infectious diagnosis was not made until 1 month after exposure , after a vascular bypass was already performed . \\n indeed , in a large multi - institutional study from thailand with a total of 102 cases of pythiosis , 60 patients received a diagnosis of vascular pythiosis , and only the patients who had undergone amputation survived . \\n further review of the literature for reports of vascular pythiosis demonstrated that the majority of patients were treated with amputation without any signs of recurrence , and were followed for 5 to 35 months post - operatively.4 , 6 , 8 , 9 in our case , complete source control was not achieved during the first operation since the common femoral artery and the proximal portion of the superficial femoral artery were oversewn and left in place , standard practice for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease . \\n incomplete source control eventually led to development of a pseudoaneurysm at the proximal anastomosis and additional surgery . \\n while the second repair was cited in previously uninvolved tissue planes , it did not protect against further infection , likely because p. insidiosum is known to invade through proteinase secretion . \\n the authors could find no reported cases of confirmed vascular pythiosis treated with limb - sparing procedures.2 , 7 , 11 , 12 medical therapy in the treatment of vascular pythiosis involves antifungal agents , immunotherapy , and iron chelation therapy . \\n much of the difficulty in eradicating this organism stems from its complicated phylogenesis;2 , 6 , 14 it shares features with true fungi at the same time it is phylogenetically more closely related to algae and diatomeae . \\n p. insidiosum develops mycelium like fungi , but its cell walls do not contain chitin and its cytoplasmic membrane lacks ergosterol , both of which are important targets of traditional antifungal drugs . despite this , drugs that affect cellular permeability , including amphotericin b , terbinafine , and the azoles , have been used with some clinical success.2 , 15 more recently , immunotherapy has been used as an adjunct to surgery and antimycotics . \\n immunotherapy was first successfully used in humans in 1998 in a patient with a vascular p. insidiosum infection refractory to surgery and antifungals.2 , 16 a p. insidiosum vaccine delivered twice with a two - week interval resulted in a cure 1 year later . \\n data collected from clinical trials and other reports estimate vaccine efficacy to be 5560%.2 , 17 the proposed mechanism of action of the p. insidiosum vaccine is to shift host adaptive immune response from a predominantly t helper 2 ( th2 ) response to a t helper 1 ( th1 ) response.2 , 17 \\n pythium exoantigens are typically processed by antigen presenting cells ( apcs ) and presented to nave cd4 helper t cells ( th0 ) . \\n this induces th0 cells to adopt a th2 phenotype secreting il-4 and il-5 , which trigger many downstream effects , including mast cell and eosinophil migration to the site of infection with subsequent degranulation , releasing inflammatory mediators and causing tissue damage . \\n loss of tissue architecture then creates a more favorable environment for these pathogenic hyphae to take hold . \\n conversion of a th2 to th1 response would favor secretion of ifn- and il-2 , leading to increased cytotoxic t lymphocyte recruitment and therefore , direct killing of p. insidiosum . in this case , the purpose of injecting ifn- subcutaneously was to augment a th1 response , and co - administration of gm - csf was to increase the efficiency of exoantigen presentation to apcs . \\n another treatment modality used to control this infection is iron chelation therapy . given the association between pythium infection in patients with hemoglobinopathies with a long - standing history of blood transfusions4 , 7 and the discovery of a ferrochelatase gene in p. insidiosum , \\n other research efforts have focused on elucidating the role of iron overload in p. insidiosum pathogenesis . \\n there is evidence that iron overload from transfusions contributes to derangements in host immunity by impairing lymphocyte function and altering phagocytosis , leading to a more susceptible state for infection6 , 19 and is in fact , a key virulence factor for the survival of p. insidiosum in the host . \\n correcting iron overload has been cited as a treatment in infections common in thalassemia , and has also been used in pythiosis . in our patient , \\n in conclusion , this patient 's vascular p. insidiosum infection was refractory to optimized medical treatment , immunotherapy with cytokine injections , and surgery . \\n attempted source control with limb salvage necessitating vascular bypass was unsuccessful in treating this case of vascular pythiosis . \\n  \\n written informed consent was obtained from the patient 's guardian for publication of this case report and accompanying images . \\n a copy of the written consent is available for review by the editor - in - chief of this journal on request.key learning pointsclinicians should maintain a high level of suspicion for vascular pythiosis when presented with a patient with an

most common cause of death is due to uncontrolled icp associated with large hemispheric infarctions10,12 ) . when it is present , it is associated with a dramatic increase in mortality . \\n in addition , early icp elevation in patients with large hemispheric infarctions is highly concluded with high mortality16 ) . \\n it means that the one of most important goal of acute phase stroke treatment is control the icp and prevent a secondary damage due to brain swelling . in spite of many clinical and experimental trials on medical therapeutic method , \\n there has been a widely accepted definite guideline for oxygen saturation , temperature , serum glucose level , blood pressure for adult stroke patient1 ) . \\n however , for pediatric stroke patient , even in many of mostly basic and elementary medical guideline has not been established yet14 ) . to prevent and control icp , thrombolytic therapy such as clot lysis has an accepted role in acute stroke treatment . in adult stroke patient group , there are antithrombotic management of adult ischemic stroke protocol and guideline published by the american heart association1 ) , such as intravenous tissue plasminogen activator , intra - arterial thrombolysis and oral administration of aspirin . \\n but , for pediatric stroke patient , there is no guideline of this useful treatment method either14 ) . to the best of our knowledge , \\n the first report about the benefits of decompressive hemicraniectomy in pediatric patient was described by carter et al.3 ) at 1997 . however , from this time , only a few report deals with decompressive craniectomy for pediatric patient were published . in adult acute stroke patient group , the effect of decompressive craniectomy also has been established . \\n vahedi et al.21 ) reported that in a meta - analysis combining the data of 93 subjects from three small , randomized , controlled trials , mortality for conservative management in adult ischemic stroke patients with early brain edema was 71% as compared with 22% for decompressive surgical intervention . nowadays \\n , some case reports and review has been published favorable outcome after decompressive surgery in childhood acute stroke2,17 ) . \\n it is not often however in some article , decompressive craniotomy have been regarded as emerging procedure can save life , for pediatric stroke patient6,11 ) , even guideline for craniectomy was introduced11 ) . in point of fact \\n widely accepted proper operation timing is immediately after signs of herniation and a midline shift which was defined as a more than equals 5-mm contralateral shift of the midline structures on the preoperative cranial ct scan on septum pellucidum level , compressed basal cisterns , or uncal herniation -- had to be present on cranial ct had been noted . \\n recent studies in adult stroke group have shown that this procedure not only reduces mortality but also improves neurological functional outcome . \\n this procedure may be life - saving if done early in cases of impending herniation , is associated with good outcomes in pediatric stroke patients9,11 ) . \\n maybe if operation was performed earlier , it may minimize the vicious circle of brain swelling , increased icp , ischemia , and infarction12 ) . in our series , four toddlers and one pre - school girl with refractory high icp due to non - traumatic , ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke \\n four patient received pcpcs score of 2 ( mild disability ) and only one received that of 3 ( moderate disability ) after 3 years later post operation . \\n these results showed that decompressive craniectomy can not only play a rescuer therapeutic role but also guaranty acceptable clinical outcome in the treatment regimen in non - traumatic , refractory high icp in pediatric field . in some articles , decompressive \\n aghakhani et al.2 ) report that decompressive craniectomy was performed in pediatric patient with malignant intracranial hypertension due to infectious encephalitis . in adult patient group , there had been not infrequently reported that malignant intracranial hypertension due to encephalitis treated with decompressive craniectomy . \\n now , even in case of pediatric patient with infectious disease in central nerve system , decompressive craniectomy could be considered as life - saving - treatment options . \\n gordon et al.7 ) report that pediatric stroke can affect not only patient itself , but also his or her whole family . \\n over half of stroke survivors have suffer from decrease in quality of life and affects the entire family , and relates to both neurological deficits and psychosocial factors11 ) . \\n hence , if all medical treatment is fail to drop the icp in non - traumatic pediatric acute stroke patient , without hesitation , a decompressive craniectomy could be regarded as next step treatment option . \\n in this study , we describes the young pediatric

fatty acid , for the therapy of absence seizures , partial seizures , tonic - clonic seizures , bipolar disorder , schizoaffective disorder , social phobias , neuropathic pain and for the prophylaxis and treatment of migraine headaches has spurred investigation for its use in the treatment of other conditions . \\n treatments for encephalopathy secondary to hyperammonemia as a side - effect of vpa treatment remain empirical and restoration of possible hepatic carnitine deficiency remains controversial . \\n while some authors have found a positive correlation between plasma ammonia level and vpa dose or concentration others have found none . \\n her elevated vpa levels were associated with elevated ammonia levels as expected of a positive correlation . \\n in contrast , later on in the patient 's clinical course her raised venous ammonia levels were found to be slowly down - trending in the presence of sub - therapeutic serum vpa . \\n the present case report is about a 25-year - old hispanic female with a history of depression since age of 12 years , bipolar disorder , borderline personality disorder , purging type bulimia and history of suicide attempts at age 12 was admitted to the intensive care unit after attempted suicide by consuming an unknown number of vpa pills . \\n this patient had recently started taking vpa ( depakote ) as a mood stabilizer at a dose of 250 mg at bed time about 3 days earlier , after a failed therapy . \\n patient was taking paroxetine 20 mg for depression ; this was incremented to 40 mg at the time vpa was started . \\n she reported that the change to vpa made her listless ,  lowered  her mood , decreased her motivation , worsened her depression and caused suicidal thoughts . \\n she overdoses herself on vpa which she took with alcohol . after ingesting the pills she notified her family who then brought her to the emergency room . on admission , \\n her vitals were stable ( blood pressure : 118/72 mm hg ; temperature : 98.7f ; pulse : 82 beats / min ; oxygen saturation : 99% on room air ) . on initial examination \\n she looked disheveled , although drowsy , was oriented to person , place and time . \\n the complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel that was recorded initially and subsequently were unremarkable [ table 1 ] . \\n subsequently , she was administered oral lactulose once and then 1400 mg of levocarnitine orally every 6 h for the next 2 days . her vpa levels which peaked after admission continued to trend down over the next 4 days \\n , the ammonia levels also peaked subsequent to admission then showed an initial dip followed by a very slow down - trend [ figure 1a ] . \\n the normalized log - linear plot of vpa serum concentration over time showed a down - trending linear first - order kinetics with a calculated t = 15.08 h [ figure 1b ] ( expected t for depakote : 9 - 16 h following oral dosing regimens of 250 - 1000 mg . the serum ammonia normalized log - linear plot in contrast showed two different decay kinetics : initial sharp down - trend for vpa levels greater than 90.9 g / ml but much slower downtrend for vpa levels less than 90.9 g / ml down into the subtherapeutic range of 8.5 g / ml . \\n patient continued to complain of lethargy for the next 4 days which subsequently alleviated . at 14 days \\n laboratory values of the patient at

levels . \\n ( b ) logarithm of normalized vpa and ammonia levels as a function of time in days . \\n the normalization for each compound , for levels at each recorded time point ( x ) was to its recorded maximum level ( xmax ) . \\n the normalized log - linear plot of vpa showed linear first - order decay kinetics with a calculated t = 15.08 h ( r = 0.994 ) \\n recognition of symptoms of hyperammonemia remains a challenge especially in psychiatric patients . in a review of 11 case reports of symptomatic hyperammonemia in a psychiatric setting it was noted that acute hyperammonemic encephalopathy in psychiatric patients may present in various ways , sometimes with subtle clinical features . \\n the previously reported spectrum of clinical features included : improvement in mood , worsening of psychiatric symptoms , mild complaints of fatigue and delirium . in our patient , \\n hyperammonemia secondary to vpa overdose caused listlessness ,  lowering  of mood , decreased motivation , worsening depression and suicidal ideation . \\n we observed presence of vpa in serum caused increased venous ammonia levels , which eventually trended down to normal after its cessation . \\n increasing vpa levels in serum was associated with increasing venous ammonia levels initially [ figure 1 ] . \\n the peak concentration of ammonia noted was likely a decrement from the real peak based on the time to peak of depakote tablets being 4 h ( the patients initial vpa levels were measured at 2 h after she allegedly consumed the vpa while the next blood draw was 9 h later ) . \\n we also made the following observations : ( 1 ) raised venous ammonia levels may remain symptomatic for a significant period of time beyond discontinuation of vpa . \\n ( 2 ) existence of more than one concurrent mechanism with different decay kinetics in the metabolism of ammonia in presence of high or low concentrations of serum vpa . \\n unmasking of an inherent urea cycle metabolic disorder could have amplified the differential decay rates of venous ammonia . \\n the possibility of more than one mechanism causing hyperammonia secondary to vpa use is suggested by the different proposed mechanisms of vpa metabolites causing hyperammonemia , these include : ( 1 ) propionic acid inhibiting the urea cycle enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase i ; ( 2 ) valproyl - coa or a closely related compound as a proximate inhibitor of mitochondrial ureagenesis ; ( 3 ) valproyl - carnitine ester causing a relative carnitine deficiency and ( 4 ) 2,4-dien - vpa inhibiting b - oxidation . \\n although , we can not speculate on the mechanisms responsible for the different kinetics of decay of ammonia levels in the presence of down - trending vpa levels we can confidently state that non - elevated hepatic enzymes and hyperammonemia despite carnitine replacement indicated that hepatic damage and carnitine deficiency had very little role in causing the slowly down - trending elevated ammonia levels in the presence of subtherapeutic serum vpa levels . \\n hyperammonemia and psychiatric disturbance secondary to valproate use in our case showed a score of 9 by a naranjo algorithm , indicating strong causality with the drug and placing it in causality category of  definite . \\n our assessment of a high adverse reaction probability scale was based on the fact that there are previous conclusive reports of hyperammonemia secondary to vpa use with similar psychiatric features as presented in this case report , hyperammonemia occurred only after vpa use and eventually trended down to normal levels with discontinuation of vpa , patients psychiatric disturbance correlated with hyperammonemia , the patient symptomatically improved with drug discontinuation , there are no alternative explanation of hyperammonemia and altered mood in this case , the serum levels of vpa were elevated with concentrations known to be toxic and that toxic effects observed were more severe with high dose and less severe when secondary hyperammonemia decreased . \\n this case report suggests that hyperammonemia , which is known to occur in about 50% patients treated with vpa , may have more than one concurrent etiologic mechanism with different decay kinetics which are not related to hepatic damage or carnitine deficiency .\", 'intramammary infection ( mastitis ) is the most common reason for the use of antimicrobials in dairy cows . \\n antimicrobials have been used to treat mastitis for more than fifty years , but consensus about the most efficient , safe , and economical treatment is still lacking . \\n the concept of evidence - based medicine has been introduced to veterinary medicine   and should apply also to treatment of mastitis . the impact on public health \\n the aim of this article is to review current treatments of mastitis during lactation and seek for evidence - based , best practice treatment recommendations for bovine mastitis . \\n penetration of substances into milk when administered parenterally or absorption and distribution throughout the udder when infused intramammarily ( imm ) depends on their pharmacokinetic characteristics . \\n these are lipid solubility , degree of ionization , extent of binding to serum and udder proteins , and the type of vehicle . \\n antimicrobial treatment of dairy cows creates residues into milk , and residue avoidance is an important aspect of mastitis treatment . \\n the activity of macrolides , tetracyclines and trimethoprim - sulphonamides has been shown to be reduced in milk . selecting a substance with a low minimum inhibitory concentraton ( mic ) value for the target pathogen \\n the antimicrobial should have bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic action , because phagocytosis is impaired in the mammary gland . \\n however , activity in vitro does not guarantee efficacy in vivo when treating bovine mastitis . \\n antimicrobial resistance amongst mastitis pathogens has not yet emerged as a clinically relevant issue , but geographical regions may differ in this respect . \\n the biggest problem is the widespread resistance of staphylococci , particularly staphylococcus aureus , to penicillin g . \\n cure rates for mastitis caused by penicillin - resistant strains of s. aureus seem to be inferior to those of mastitis due to penicillin - susceptible strains . \\n it is not known if this is due to pharmacologic problems of the drugs used , or virulence factors possibly linked to -lactamase gene of the resistant isolates . using an in vitro -lactamase test for determining resistance to penicillin g of staphylococci before treatment \\n coagulase - negative staphylococci tend to be more resistant than s. aureus and easily develop multiresistance . \\n mastitis causing streptococci have remained susceptible to penicillin g , but emerging resistance to macrolides and lincosamides has been detected . \\n antimicrobial susceptibility of coliform bacteria varies but normally is not a limiting factor for therapy . \\n an important question regarding the treatment of mastitis is whether the antimicrobial should accumulate in the milk or in the udder tissue . \\n the target site may depend on the causative agent : streptococci are known to remain in the milk compartment , but s. aureus penetrates udder tissue and causes deep infection ( table 1 ) . \\n the advantages of this route are high concentrations of the substance achieved in the milk and low consumption of the antimicrobial as the drug is directly infused into the diseased quarter . \\n for example , concentration of penicillin g in milk after imm administration is 100 - 1000 times as high as the concentration after systemic ( parenteral ) administration . \\n a disadvantage of the imm administration is uneven distribution throughout the udder   and the risk of infecting the quarter when infusing the product via the teat canal . \\n efficacy of imm treatment varies according to the causative pathogen , with the best therapeutic response being shown for mastitis caused by streptococci , coagulase - negative staphylococci , and corynebacterium spp .. where to target antimicrobial therapy in clinical mastitis due to different pathogens   the systemic route of administration has been suggested to be more efficient than imm for the treatment of clinical mastitis as antimicrobials theoretically have better penetration of the udder tissue by this route . \\n however , it is difficult to attain and maintain therapeutic concentrations in milk or udder tissue following systemic administration . \\n many commonly used broad - spectrum antimicrobials such as oxytetracycline , trimethoprim - sulphonamide and ceftiofur , it is difficult to produce and maintain therapeutic concentrations in the milk . \\n macrolides would have ideal pharmacokinetics , but clinical studies have failed to demonstrate efficacy when used for the systemic treatment of clinical mastitis . in streptococcal mastitis , spiramycin and tylosin have shown reasonable efficacy . \\n one additional problem for the bovine practitioner is that the recommended dosage for many antibiotic preparations for adult cattle may be too low when pharmacological aspects are considered , but residue studies have been carried out using the approved dosages . \\n repeated intramuscular injections of large volumes of antibiotics can be irritating and can not be recommended from the animal welfare point of view . \\n one substance used for systemic treatment is penicillin g , which as a weak acid penetrates poorly into the mammary gland , however , due to the very low mic values of susceptible organisms , therapeutic concentrations can be achieved in milk . \\n penethamate is a more liphophilic penicillin g formulation and diffuses better than penicillin g procaine into milk . \\n the efficacy of systemic treatment with penicillin g or penethamate has been shown in clinical trials . \\n combinations of penicillin and aminoglycosides should not be used , as there is no scientific evidence demonstrating a better efficacy for the combination   and aminoglycosides are known to produce long - lasting residues . \\n the only type of mastitis where systemic treatment would be clearly advantageous may be mastitis caused by s. aureus . \\n in severe mastitis due to coliform bacteria , parenteral administration of antimicrobials has been suggested to combat bacteraemia . \\n the general benefit of antimicrobial treatment in coliform mastitis has been questioned , but systemic antimicrobial treatment is recommended in cases of severe escherichia coli mastitis with heavy bacterial growth in the udder . \\n fluroquinolones and cefquinome have shown efficacy in experimental trials   and ceftiofur in a clinical field trial . \\n there is no evidence that administering bactericidal antimicrobials to cows with severe coliform mastitis causes the release of massive amounts of endotoxin . \\n finally , the antimicrobial used for systemic treatment of mastitis must be approved for dairy cattle . \\n for example , penicillin g procaine or fluoroquinolones are not approved for dairy cattle in the united states . \\n treatment of mastitis should be targeted towards the causative bacteria whenever possible , but in acute situations , treatment is initiated based on herd data and personal experience . rapid or on - farm bacteriological diagnosis would facilitate the selection of the most appropriate antimicrobial . \\n treatment protocols and drug selection for each farm should be made by veterinarians familiar with the farm . \\n the use of on - farm written protocols for mastitis treatment can promote judicious use of antimicrobials . therapeutic response of the cows can be monitored using individual somatic cell count data if available , or using the california mastitis test , and with bacteriological samples in herds with contagious mastitis . in general , the use of narrow - spectrum antimicrobials is preferable ( table 2 ) . \\n first choice antimicrobials for treating mastitis caused by streptococci and penicillin - susceptible staphylococci are -lactam antimicrobials , particularly penicillin g. broad - spectrum antimicrobials such as third or fourth generation cephalosporins should not be used as first alternatives for mastitis , as they may increase emergence of broad - spectrum -lactam resistance . \\n systemic treatment is recommended in clinical mastitis due to s. aureus and in severe cases of coliform mastitis , preferably in combination with imm treatment . too short \\n a duration of standard treatment is probably an important reason for poor cure rates in mastitis therapy . \\n a longer treatment improves cure rates , and duration of treatment should generally be extended in mastitis caused by s. aureus and streptococcus uberis . \\n clinical mastitis should be treated for at least three days ; this recommended treatment duration is longer than label treatments in many countries . \\n all mastitis treatment should be evidence based i.e. , the efficacy of each product and treatment length should be demonstrated by scientific studies . \\n treating subclinical mastitis with antimicrobials is generally not economical during lactation because of high treatment costs and poor efficacy . in a study with a large number of subclinical mastitis cases , the overall bacteriological cure rate for antimicrobial treatment was 75% and that for no treatment 68% . the marginal benefit applied for streptococcal mastitis only ; in mastitis due to s. aureus , antimicrobials were equal to no treatment . \\n treatment of subclinical mastitis will not affect the incidence of mastitis in the herd unless other preventive measures are taken . \\n studies on treating cows based on high somatic cell counts have generally shown that no effect on milk production has been achieved   in herd problems caused by very contagious bacteria such as s. aureus or streptococcus agalactiae treatment of subclinical mastitis is advised .', 'chondroblastoma accounts for < 1% of all primary bone tumors . usually occurring in young adolescents , \\n however , unusual sites of presentation such as patella , talocalcaneal , and temporomandibular joint has been reported . \\n since last decade , fine needle aspiration cytology ( fnac ) has evolved as a simple , safe , and noninvasive preoperative tool in the diagnosis of bone tumors . \\n it is necessary to differentiate chondroblastoma from other giant cell - rich lesions , as chondroblastoma exhibits predominantly benign behavior , though recurrences and metastasis are on record . \\n we report cytomorphology in two

, patella , talus , calcaneum , and temporomandibular joint . \\n most of the chondroblastomas are benign in nature requiring simple curettage and bone grafting . however , recurrence is known to occur in 10 - 38% of the cases . \\n metastases are unusual but occur in the lungs at the time of recurrence . as in most of the cases of bone tumors , \\n this , compounded with nonconforming radiological features , leads to the tragic delay in diagnosis . though the age of the patient and location of the lesion in the given bone are key pieces of information , accurate and early diagnosis is a must for planning appropriate treatment . \\n the past decade has witnessed the impressive use of fnac in the diagnosis of bone tumors . despite this , we have a limited case series describing fnac findings in chondroblastoma \\n . fna aspirates of chondroblastoma show mononuclear cells arranged in a dispersed pattern like pebbles . \\n these cells have well - defined cell margins , glassy cytoplasm , and nucleus with indentation and grooving . \\n apart from associated giant cells and chondroid matrix , the chicken wire calcification that has been described in histopathology sections can be readily appreciated in fnac smears and can be a clue to diagnosis . \\n however , errors in the fnac diagnosis of this rare tumor are known to occur , with the major pitfalls being its association with aneurysmal bone cyst ( abc ) leading to a nonrepresentative aspirate and the occurrence of a plethora of giant cell - rich lesions in the differentials . \\n in one large series of 12 cases of chondroblastoma , the authors described the cytomorphology of this tumor in detail . \\n the diagnosis was missed on fnac , among which , one was associated with abc and in another case an erroneous diagnosis of a giant cell tumor was made . \\n the cause of misdiagnosis in one case was due to its association with abc , leading to nonrepresentative aspirate . in the second case , due to the location of the tumor in preauricular region , cartilaginous stroma aspirated \\n , in a study of 110 cases of bone lesions attributed the missed diagnosis in two cases of chondroblastoma at fnac to inadequate sampling and misinterpretation as giant cell tumor . \\n in giant cell tumor , the mononuclear cells are spindle - shaped and occur in clusters . in chondromyxoid fibroma , the smears are sparsely cellular and lack the mononuclear cell component . instead , stellate cells with pleomorphism are noted . \\n aspirates in abc are usually hemorrhagic , scantily cellular , composed of osteoclast giant cells , histiocytes , osteoblasts , and spindle cells . \\n in addition to chondroblastoma , abc can occur secondarily in giant cell tumor and osteosarcoma . \\n this report reiterates the cytomorphologic findings in chondroblastoma and its differential diagnosis from other giant cell containing lesions of bone . \\n the collective application of the knowledge of the cytomorphological features of this rare bone tumor would aid in accurate preoperative diagnosis even in the absence of typical clinical and radiologic presentations . \\n  \\n ', 'suicide is a grave public health issue with a global mortality rate of 16 per 100,000 individuals.1 suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death , particularly among individuals aged 1544 years , which is a productive age group.1 suicide is a complex event that is influenced by biological , cultural , psychological , and socioeconomic factors . \\n more than 90% of suicide victims were diagnosed with psychiatric problems at the time of death , and approximately two thirds had been diagnosed with depression.2,3 depressed patients tend to consult physicians other than psychiatrists , and a variety of medical professionals , including general practitioners , the staff of emergency departments , and non - psychiatric nurses , are key interveners for preventing suicide . among medical staff members , negative attitudes toward suicide such as \\n anger could affect nontherapeutic reactions to suicidal individuals.4 furthermore , a belief that suicide is a personal right was negatively related to suicide intervention skills.5 an accurate assessment of the attitudes toward suicide held by medical staff members is relevant . \\n previous studies have shown that difficulties with parental bonding during childhood could be a predisposing factor for the onset of many psychiatric conditions , such as anxiety , depressive states , and maladjusted behaviors.68 parental bonding and premorbid personality traits play an important role in shaping the developmental trajectory of an individual , including his / her ability to adjust to stressful events . \\n although few studies have assessed the relationship between parental bonding and mental conditions among medical staff members,9,10 no study has evaluated the association between parental bonding and attitudes toward suicide . \\n the objective of this study was to investigate whether parental bonding is associated with attitudes toward suicide among medical college students in japan . \\n students in their fifth year of

associations with parental bonding among japanese medical college students . \\n the majority of the participants in our study agreed that anyone could commit suicide ( 88.8% ) and that suicide is preventable ( 86.3% ) . \\n in addition , the multiple regression analysis revealed that participants who reported a higher level of maternal care thought that suicide was a common occurrence and tended to think that people do not have the right to commit suicide . \\n domino and takahashi used the suicide opinion questionnaire to investigate the differences in attitudes toward suicide between students in japan and those in the united states , and the results demonstrated that the scores for  right to die  and  normality  were higher in japanese students and that those for  aggression  were higher in american students.14 etzersdorfer et al compared the attitudes towards suicide held by medical students in madras with those in vienna , finding that medical students in madras rejected the right to commit suicide and assisted suicide to a greater degree than the students in vienna.15 in a swedish study to assess whether attitudes differ between students at the beginning and end of their studies , students in the final year of medical school more frequently considered suicide to be an expression of psychiatric disease and thought that people attempting to commit suicide were not responsible for their actions.16 in addition , a study from japan revealed that sympathetic comments increased with the amount of years in school among students while critical comments decreased.17 in japan , mentality on suicide might be more culturally visible and acceptable than other countries . in past years , suicide was regarded as an honorable solution to personal guilt and failure . regarding occupational differences in attitudes toward suicide , \\n onc et al found that medical students and general practitioners held the most permissive attitudes in turkey.18 in addition , they showed that the attitude scores of general practitioners regarding their preparedness to prevent suicide were lower compared to those of other groups . in japan , kodaka et al reported attitudes toward suicide among pharmacists using the atts.13 more than half of pharmacists reported that people understand the wishes of others to commit suicide , and 16.8% of the participants thought that people who mention suicide do not actually take their own lives . \\n a 10 year follow - up study of norwegian physicians ( n=631 ) revealed that a low level of maternal care predicted severe depressive symptoms and partially mediated low self - esteem.9 lung et al assessed the psychological effects on 127 health care workers who had cared for suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) patients . \\n early maternal attachment and neuroticism were found to heavily affect mental health during life - threatening stress.10 distinct patterns of parental bonding may contribute to the development of different dysfunctional schemas which may influence attitudes toward suicide.19 there are several limitations in this study . \\n first , we used pbi to assess the child rearing behavior experienced by our participants . \\n although pbi has shown basic reliability for long periods,20 we could not completely rule out possible influences of the current mood state or recall bias in individuals because pbi is an instrument for measuring recalled parental behaviors . \\n second , certain parameters were not assessed in this study personality traits , a history of psychiatric disorders , suicidal behavior , and current mood state could affect the attitude towards suicidal behavior . third , because the participants in our study are medical students , we can not generalize these results to general practitioners . \\n our study indicated that the majority of participants seriously believe that anyone could commit suicide . \\n participants who have experienced a higher level of maternal care thought that suicide occurs commonly and tended to think that people do not have the right to commit suicide . \\n although parental bonding predisposes these attitudes toward suicide , educational programs could change caretaking practices.21 to achieve more positive attitudes towards suicidal behavior , promoting the best practices for suicide prevention is needed for medical students .', 'neurofibromatosis ( nf ) is an autosomal dominant disease , discovered in 1882 , by the german pathologist friedrich daniel von recklinghausen , characterized by disordered growth of ectodermal tissues , and is part of a group of disorders called phakomatoses ( neurocutaneous syndrome ) . \\n neurofibromatosis type - i ( nf-1 ) , also known as von recklinghausen syndrome , is caused by the mutation of a gene on the long arm of chromosome 17 , which encodes a protein known as neurofibromin . \\n it is characterized by spots of increased skin pigmentation ( caf au lait

miller and sparkes modified the nomenclature to segmental neurofibromatosis ( sn )  the current term for neurofibromas of segmental distribution . \\n the commonly affected sites for sn are the thorax and abdomen ( 55% ) , upper extremities ( 20% ) , and lower limb and face ( 10% each ) . only few cases ( less than 10 ) of segmental neurofibromatosis over the face have been described so far . \\n a 26-year - old female patient reported to the dental department complaining about the unesthetic appearance of her face , since eight years [ figure 1 ] . \\n history revealed that eight years back , the patient underwent surgery in the neck region for a cyst and one to two days after surgery the patient got a swelling on the face . \\n the swelling was of the same size since then and there was no pain associated with the swelling . \\n the unesthetic appearance of the face on examination , the face of the patient appeared asymmetrical , bilaterally , with a growth on the right side of the face . \\n the skin over the right side of her face was thickened and hyperpigmented , with a soft and loose hanging overgrowth . \\n there were numerous small and large , sessile and pedunculated nodular growths localized on the right side of her neck , with dark - colored underlying skin . \\n the skin over the right cheek and chin area showed coffee - colored pigmentation ( caf - au - lait spots ) [ figure 2 ] . \\n nodular growths localized on the right side of the neck with dark colored underlying skin there was a soft , compressible , nontender growth on the lower lip . \\n the right ear showed disfigurement and hypertrophy , with thickened cartilage and overlying hyperpigmented skin [ figure 3 ] . \\n disfigurement of the ear and hypertrophy with thickened cartilage and overlying hyperpigmented skin intraorally there were numerous soft tissue growths with a sessile base seen on the right buccal mucosa [ figure 4 ] and tongue [ figure 5 ] . \\n soft tissue growths with sessile bases on right buccal mucosa soft tissue growths with sessile bases on the tongue laboratory findings revealed a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) ( 70 mm in the first hour ) , a decreased hemoglobin level ( 7.5 gm% ) , and the enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) was found to be nonreactive . a panoramic radiograph disclosed asymmetric enlargement of the right side of the mandible , with loss of cortication of the lower border in the midline area , expansion of the body of the mandible causing displacement of the teeth , seen on right side , expansion of the right inferior alveolar nerve canal , enlarged mental foramen , resorption of the roots of the mandibular right teeth , and loss of the right antegonial notch . \\n a deficiency was seen on the right side of the maxilla , with crowding of the posterior teeth [ figure 6 ] . \\n a panoramic radiograph the right lateral oblique radiograph revealed a deep sigmoid notch , loss of the antegonial notch , an enlarged and rounded coronoid process , with resorption of the mandibular right teeth [ figure 7 ] . \\n a right lateral oblique radiograph subsequently , biopsy of one of the nodules was taken and sent for histopathological examination . \\n the histopathological slide revealed a non - encapsulated tumor of the dermis with a normal overlying epidermis . \\n the tumor consisted of loosely spaced spindle cells and wavy collagenous strands in a clear matrix [ figure 8 ] . a non - encapsulated tumor of the dermis , with a normal overlying epidermis \\n these tumors are composed of schwann cells , fibroblasts , mast cells , and vascular components . \\n the caf au lait spots are irregularly - shaped , evenly pigmented , brown macules . \\n most individuals with neurofibromatosis have six or more spots that are 1.5 cm or greater in diameter . in young children , \\n five or more caf au lait macules , greater than 0.5 cm in diameter , are suggestive of neurofibromatosis . \\n less than 1% of the healthy children have three or more such spots , although one or two caf au lait macules are commonly encountered in healthy individuals without disease . \\n bone involvement includes pseudoarthrosis of the tibia , bowing of the long bones , and orbital defects . \\n treatment of neurofibromatosis is predominantly surgical . when neurofibromas increase in size or cause pain , malignant transformation must be suspected , and excision or biopsy must be performed . \\n acoustic neuromas and tumors that cause tinnitus and vertigo must be excised with great caution . \\n plastic surgeons may be included in the correction of deformities , especially those of the face . considering the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of neurofibromatosis , genetic counseling', \"the gram - negative coccobacillus pasteurella multocida is normally found in the oral cavity of dogs and cats . it is a recognised cause of wound infection as a result of bites , licking or scratching . \\n bacteraemia and endocarditis are uncommon complications and , from literature reviews , are found to be associated with prior animal trauma , a second source of infection ( e.g. cellulitis ) and high mortality rates . \\n we herein report a case in which a pet owner developed p. multocida endocarditis and was subsequently treated via opat ( outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy ) service with an excellent clinical outcome . \\n species identification of p. multocida was performed using traditional microbiological methods and confirmed with 16s rrna sequencing and matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization time - of - flight mass spectrometry ( maldi - tof ) . \\n a 38-year - old man was admitted to our hospital with a 2 days history of fever , malaise and cellulitis around a mitrofanoff abdominal catheter . \\n multiple comorbidities included marfan syndrome ( with metallic aortic valve inserted sixteen years before ) and congenital urological abnormalities that led to the mitrofanoff appendicovesicostomy and a recent renal transplant , five years and six months before admission respectively . \\n he was on steroids and tacrolimus as immunosuppressive therapy . on presentation , the patient was febrile , hypotensive and tachycardic , had a normal leukocyte count ( 5.0910/l ) but raised creactive protein ( crp ) 45 \\n mg / l with mild anaemia ( hb of 10.1 g / dl from a baseline of 14.6 g / dl ) and renal impairment ( creatinine 163 umol / l and urea 8.1 mmol / l ) . \\n the cellulitis around the mitrofanoff abdominal catheter was noted and a swab was taken for culture . \\n his chest x - ray did not show any relevant consolidation and abdominal ultrasound noted two small abdominal collections that had already been noted post - transplant and had since decreased in size . \\n the patient was documented to be penicillin allergic ( previous skin rash ) , so was initiated on ertapenem iv 1 gr / od . the cellulitis improved and the patient was clinically well within 48 hours of commencing antibiotics . \\n the blood culture set ( aerobic and anaerobic bottles ) taken on admission was positive with p. multocida but the abdominal swab grew only mixed anaerobes . \\n urine culture was negative and all subsequent blood cultures taken after starting ertapenem were negative after 5 days of incubation . \\n transesophageal ( tee ) echocardiography revealed the presence of a vegetation ( 0.57 0.2 cm ) above the atrium of the right coronary artery . \\n a previous transthoracic echocardiogram ( tte ) , around one month prior to admission , was reported as negative . \\n therefore , the patient was treated following our local protocol for infective endocarditis : he was switched to ceftriaxone iv 2 gr / od , a picc line was inserted in the right arm and he was discharged under the opat ( outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy ) service to complete six weeks iv antibiotics as an outpatient . on follow - up , two repeat ttes showed clear aortic valve . \\n we reviewed all the previous reported cases of p. multocida endocarditis in the literature through pubmed and cross - references search . \\n to our knowledge this is the twenty - first reported case of endocarditis but the first to be reported in a penicillin allergic patient . as with previous cases , \\n the diagnosis of infective endocarditis was made according to duke criteria : one major criterion ( evidence of endocardial involvement ) and three minor criteria ( predisposing heart condition , fever and microbiological evidence with positive blood culture ) . \\n laboratory isolation and identification of p. multocida was performed using standard microbiological techniques : api-20ne , api-20e ( biomerieux ) and the phoenix automated system ( bd ) . \\n interestingly , both api profiles reported a low confidence value for identification as p. multocida to the species level ( cv 53% ) and the phoenix assay only identified the isolate to genus level as pasteurella spp . thus , confirmation of species identification was performed using 16s rrna sequencing and maldi - tof protein profiling : 16s rrna sequence was performed using pcr parameters detailed in maskell na et al . \\n ( 2006 ) and we obtained a 584bp fragment sharing 99% sequence homology to that of p. multocida sub species septica . \\n maldi - tof profiling was performed using a bruker daltonics microflex platform with recommended -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix under pre - defined conditions as specified by bruker . \\n the maldi - tof mass spectra for the clinical isolate was analysed against maldi - tof mass spectra for 3,438 species of bacteria located in the bruker daltonics flexanalysis 3.0 database . \\n the clinical isolate was identified as p. multocida with a confidence value of 2.321 indicating highly probable species identification , with no differential bacterial species being reported . \\n sensitivities were as follow ( eucast breakpoints ) : penicillin mic ( mg / l ) was 0.19 , ciprofloxacin 0.016 , doxycycline 0.5 , co - trimoxazole 0.032 , ertapenem 0.016 and ceftriaxone < 0.016 , all being susceptible . of note \\n the accuracy of previous reports in the literature has been questioned as their standard microbiological description was incomplete and pasteurella species may be misidentified as haemophilus spp . \\n they both belong to the pasteurellaceae family and based on the genomic sequence it appears they diverged approximately 270 million years ago . \\n are gram - negative coccobacilli generally present in the oral cavity of cats and dogs . to date twenty - one species \\n have been identified and the species p. multocida can be further divided into three different subspecies ( subspecies multocida , septicum and gallicida ) . \\n the spectrum of infections varies from skin and soft tissue to central nervous system infections . \\n ten out of twenty - one ( 47.6% ) endocarditis cases described in the literature had close contact with animals detailed in the clinical history . \\n our patient did not have a clear history of bites or scratches but he did have two cats at home and close contact with dogs at his sister 's house . \\n in fact , of the cases of p. multocida endocarditis reviewed , two out of twenty - one ( 9.5% ) had cirrhosis as underlying condition . \\n penicillin still remains the best antimicrobial agent for the treatment of virtually all forms of pasteurella infection . \\n a fluoroquinolone , doxycycline , or co - trimoxazole should be considered for skin and soft tissue infections as an alternative for patients with intolerance to -lactams . there are no clear guidelines about the treatment of p. multocida endocarditis in penicillin - allergic patients . \\n the patient was known to be penicillin allergic ( previous rash ) and ciprofloxacin and doxycycline were contraindicated as causing interaction with his anticoagulant treatment . \\n we decided then to switch to ceftriaxone as this antibiotic is already vastly used in the treatment of endocarditis caused by other gram - negative organisms and is more cost effective . \\n aminoglycosides have moderate to poor in vitro activity against pasteurella and probably should not be used , particularly given the paucity of clinical experience . finally , our patient improved within 48 hours of commencing antimicrobial therapy and surgical intervention was unnecessary . from the literature , \\n only three other cases have been successfully treated with solely antibiotics and valve replacement was mandatory in seventeen out of twenty - one ( 81% ) of cases described . \\n clinicians may face various challenges , from achieving the correct species identification to chosing treatment regimens in penicillin - allergic patients . in our case new diagnostic techniques such as 16s rrna sequencing and maldi - tof were demonstrated to be invaluable tools for species confirmation . \\n we propose that maldi - tof is a rapid , accurate method for the identification of p. multocida from bacterial cultures and can significantly reduce the time to diagnosis of p. multocida bacteraemia . \\n furthermore we have shown that cephalosporins and carbapenems are probably good substitutes for penicillin in case of allergy .\", \"patient aged 64 was admitted to the county hospital urology ward in september 2010 and diagnosed with tumor of the left kidney . \\n ultrasonographic exam revealed the structure with a diameter of 45 mm in

pathogens initiating the course of the disease could be both , the epstein  barr viruses which attack the b  lymphocytes , and by htlv1 viruses dwelling in t  lymphocytes and causing a subacute form of leukemia among adults . \\n there can also be some co  factors of environmental character : chloro  organic compounds , ionization energy , benzene  like substances , states of immunosuppression and autoimmunological diseases . \\n the malignant lymphoma morbidity rate can also be increased by extensive exposition to herbicides , and is even 35 times higher among patients with a kidney transplant . \\n it usually dwells within the lymphoid tissue of waldeyer 's ring , spleen and thymus . \\n extranodal lymphomas can most often be found in the gastrointestinal tract , other types can be located in skin , bones , eye \\n kidney might be at the stage of involvement which spreads through lymphatic system from the nodes in retro peritoneum . \\n if the renal involvement occurs at an advanced stage of the disease , as yet another location of it , it is relatively easy to diagnose . \\n once a patient is diagnosed with lymphoma of kidney , further examinations are required in order to rule out a systemic disease . \\n the necessary test in such cases include : blood tests , bone marrow biopsy , radiological examination , pathomorphological evaluation and histo  immunological evaluation of enlarged lymph nodes . \\n the malignant types , however , build up rapidly , are resistant to treatment and show no signs of improvement within a short period of time . \\n how long the patient will live depends on the histopathological diagnosis of the tumor and its stage of development . \\n non  hodgkin lymphomas are treated with chemotherapy , radiation , and , in some cases , surgeries . low  malignant , originally extranodal , tumors are usually surgically removed and treated with radiotherapy . \\n cell lymphoma associated with chronic inflammation arising in a renal

on cases of co  existence of inflammatory intestines disease , including the crohn disease , and malignant lymphomas but then changes can most frequently be located in the vicinity of intestines or other adjacent sections of the digestive tract . \\n the presented case leads to a conclusion that each focal lesion of unclear etiology found on imagining studies should be treated as a possible malignant lymphoma and ought to be histopathologically verified as quickly as possible .\", \"genital infection due to chlamydia trachomatis is one of the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infections ( stis ) . according to the who estimates , globally 92 million new cases of c. trachomatis infection \\n occur each year and about two - thirds of these cases occur in the developing world , where diagnostic and treatment services are scarce [ 2 , 3 ] . \\n most epidemiological data on chlamydia trachomatis infection ( cti ) is from industrialized nations and reliable data from the resource poor developing nations is not available where the disease burden is concentrated . \\n however , it is important to document laboratory - confirmed incidence and prevalence of cti from the developing world as well . \\n the available indian data show a wide variation in ct prevalence with infection rates in indian women ranging from 3.3% to 33% depending on the population sampled [ 413 ] . \\n infection with this agent is usually asymptomatic in up to 80% of women which makes diagnosis and detection all the more difficult . left undetected and untreated the infection may evolve into pelvic inflammatory disease and may result in serious sequelae , such as ectopic pregnancy and infertility [ 14 , 15 ] . \\n cti in women has also been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes like recurrent miscarriage and preterm labor and may cause conjunctivitis , nasopharyngitis , and pneumonia in newborns by vertical transmission . because the infection is easily treatable with antibiotics , early detection and treatment of infected individuals \\n are the key to prevent adverse sequelae among those infected and reduce c. trachomatis transmission . \\n thus , it is important to screen adolescents and sexually active women for cti even if they are asymptomatic [ 17 , 18 ] . but , in the developing countries with the exception of sporadic testing , screening for chlamydia is rarely done . \\n epidemiological studies have also shown that untreated genital chlamydia infection can lead to an increased risk for heterosexual acquisition of hiv . hence , screening for cti done in high risk populations can assist in designing hiv risk reduction strategies . \\n on the other hand , immunosuppression due to hiv may lead to more aggressive chlamydia disease conditions like pid in hiv seropositive women . \\n thus , screening for cti in hiv seropositive women is highly recommended to prevent morbidity associated with the disease and devastating clinical consequences . \\n different diagnostic modalities for detection of cti like serology , culture method , elisa for antigen and antibody , direct fluorescence assay ( dfa ) and nucleic acid amplification tests ( naats ) have been used in the last 20 years but none of them are 100% sensitive . \\n table 1 shows the prevalence of cti detected by using different diagnostic techniques in new delhi population . \\n polymerase chain reaction is an accurate , rapid , and reliable method for the detection of chlamydia trachomatis . \\n real - time pcr has increasingly been used and is easier to perform and faster , and since it is performed in a closed system it is less prone to contamination than the conventional pcr . keeping the above background in mind this study was undertaken to generate reliable data regarding prevalence of cti in hiv - infected and hiv - uninfected women by real - time pcr , the most sensitive and specific test available currently for diagnosing genital chlamydia infection . \\n the primary objective of this study was to establish the need for screening hiv seropositive women for cti . \\n study subjects were recruited as follows : thirty adult hiv seropositive women with symptoms suggestive of rtis ( study group a1),thirty adult hiv seropositive women without symptoms suggestive of rtis ( study group a2),thirty age and sex matched adult hiv seronegative women with symptoms suggestive of rtis ( control group b1),thirty age and sex matched adult hiv seronegative women without symptoms suggestive of rtis ( control group b2 ) . \\n thirty adult hiv seropositive women with symptoms suggestive of rtis ( study group a1 ) , thirty adult hiv seropositive women without symptoms suggestive of rtis ( study group a2 ) , thirty age and sex matched adult hiv seronegative women with symptoms suggestive of rtis ( control group b1 ) , thirty age and sex matched adult hiv seronegative women without symptoms suggestive of rtis ( control group b2 ) . \\n all the study subjects were enrolled from the integrated counseling and testing center ( ictc ) for hiv / aids , department of microbiology , maulana azad medical college , which is attached to the lok nayak hospital , new delhi . \\n this study was conducted prospectively between july 2010 and january 2011 at the hiv molecular laboratory of the department of microbiology , maulana azad medical college . \\n this was a cross - sectional analysis to determine the prevalence of chlamydia trachomatis infection by using real - time pcr in hiv seropositive and seronegative , symptomatic , and asymptomatic women visiting the ictc of our department . \\n subjects were enrolled in this study following institutional ethical committee clearance and a written informed consent of all participants . each participant was interviewed using a questionnaire concerning general sociodemographic information , personal details , and clinical symptoms . \\n subjects having one or more of the following symptoms were considered symptomatic for rti : vaginal discharge , vesicular and/or nonvesicular genital ulcers , inguinal bubo , lower abdominal pain , genital skin conditions , urinary burning or frequency , dysmenorrhea , menorrhagia , and intermenstrual bleeding . \\n vesicular and/or nonvesicular genital ulcers , lower abdominal pain , genital skin conditions , urinary burning or frequency , dysmenorrhea , menorrhagia , and intermenstrual bleeding . \\n each study subject then underwent a general physical , per abdomen , per speculum , and per vaginum examination . \\n diagnosis of hiv infection was done by following the standard protocol at our ictc that employs pretest and posttest counseling and obtains informed consent before hiv testing . \\n three different rapid tests were used to detect hiv-1 and hiv-2 antibodies ( combaids ( span diagnostics ltd . ) , retrocheck hiv ( qualpro diagnostics ) , and tri - line ( rapid diagnostics ) ) following the manufacturer 's instructions . \\n one endocervical swab was collected from all participants according to the instructions provided in the specimen collection and transport kit ( amplicor std swab collection and transport set ) for detection of chlamydia trachomatis by real - time pcr . \\n genital c. trachomatis infection was diagnosed by using cobas taqman ct test , v2.0 , an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for the qualitative detection of chlamydia trachomatis dna in female endocervical swab specimens . \\n specimens were processed using the amplicor ct / ng specimen preparation kit for manual specimen preparation and the cobas taqman 48 analyzer for automated amplification and detection ( roche diagnostics ) . \\n the age and gender profile of all the participants is shown in table 2 . in both the hiv seropositive study group and the hiv seronegative control group \\n the mean age of hiv - infected cases was found to be 30.92  5.7 years and in hiv - uninfected controls 28.52  6.9 years . \\n table 3 shows the presenting complaints of the symptomatic women in both the hiv seropositive study group and the hiv seronegative control group . \\n vaginal discharge and lower abdominal pain were the most common presenting complaints amongst the symptomatic participants . \\n table 4 shows the sti / rti syndromes diagnosed in study subjects on per speculum examination . \\n vaginitis was the most common syndrome diagnosed in both the study and the control groups . \\n table 5 shows the correlation between presence of symptoms and cti in the study and the control groups . \\n chlamydia trachomatis infection was more commonly diagnosed in the asymptomatic hiv seropositive study subjects as compared to the symptomatic hiv seropositive study subjects . in our study \\n the prevalence of cti was higher in hiv seropositive women as compared to hiv seronegative women ( or 4.214 ; 95% ci 0.45738.865 ) and among the hiv positive asymptomatic as compared to the hiv negative asymptomatic ( or 2.111 ; 95% ci 1.6062.776 ) , although the differences were not found to be statistically significant ( table 6 ) . \\n in india stis / rtis and hiv / aids are major public health problems . incidence and prevalence data have a key role in control strategies for hiv and stis . \\n comprehensive baseline information on the epidemiology of stis is essential for the design , implementation , and monitoring of successful control programs to reduce their incidence . \\n routine surveillance of stis / rtis is not carried out in our country due to the lack of laboratory diagnostic facilities , limited resources , stigma , and discrimination associated with stis and poor attendance of sti patients , especially women , in sexually transmitted disease ( std ) clinics . taking the above facts into consideration , \\n it is meaningful to have genuine laboratory - confirmed data on the incidence / prevalence of rtis / stis in india . as the asymptomatic nature of stis \\n is well known , there is a need to adopt a specific strategy for the screening of the sexually active population in india to reduce the overall rate of stis , which would , in turn , reduce the risk of hiv infection . \\n our study presents an insight into the prevalence data of genital chlamydia infections in hiv - infected and hiv - uninfected women visiting the ictc of new delhi 's largest tertiary care hospital . \\n the mean age of the hiv seropositive subjects in our study was 30.92  5.7 and that of the hiv seronegative control group was 28.52  6.9 . \\n this compares well with the findings of another study done in baroda , india , to look for the prevalence of rtis in hiv - infected women wherein the mean age for hiv positive women was 30 and that for hiv negative women was 27 . \\n the predominant age group in the hiv positive participants in our study was 2635 years . \\n this association of chlamydia infection with younger age is consistent with studies from other developing countries [ 32 , 33 ] . \\n this finding supports the fact that young sexually active adults should constitute a priority target group in the sti control program . \\n however , the findings of our study can not be generalized to all sexually active adults as the study has its limitations of a small sample size and the study participants belonging to a high risk group being recruited from the ictc of our department . \\n 80% of our hiv positive study participants were married which is quiet similar to what has been reported by another study from sub - saharan africa in which 85.3% of the hiv - infected women were married . \\n this finding highlights the importance of concurrently screening and treating spouses / sexual partners to decrease the sti burden in the country but this is challenging due to the lack of knowledge and cooperation from husbands especially in the indian setup . in the present study , vaginal discharge and lower abdominal pain \\n were the 2 most frequently reported symptoms by the symptomatic women in both the study and the control groups , confirming the data reported by some previous indian studies [ 22 , 29 ] . \\n another notable observation of our study was that vaginitis was the most common clinical finding detected on per speculum examination in both the hiv positive ( 50% ) and the hiv negative groups ( 56.67% ) which is in accordance with the observations of garg et al . and \\n balamurugan and bendigeri where a majority of women on clinical examination had vaginitis of 94.6% and 36.9%% , respectively [ 22 , 35 ] . \\n the present study also validates the fact that chlamydia infections are usually asymptomatic as 10% of the asymptomatic women were diagnosed with cti while only 3.3% of symptomatic women had lab - confirmed cti in the hiv positive study group . \\n once again this emphasizes the importance of routine screening of at risk young sexually active women . in our study \\n cti was detected in 6.67% ( 4/60 ) hiv - infected women and in 1.67% ( 1/60 ) hiv - uninfected women by real - time pcr although this difference was not statistically significant but the odds ratio was 4.214 . a study from cuba reported c. trachomatis infection in 10% of hiv - infected cases and 6.6% of hiv - uninfected cases by nested pcr but \\n the difference was not statistically significant while the odds ratio was 3.39 which is in concordance with our study . \\n studies conducted by natividad - villanueva et al . in usa and seck et al . in senegal reported c. trachomatis infection in 3.33% and 2.1% of hiv - infected females , respectively [ 38 , 39 ] . \\n larger studies are required to validate our observation as our study was restricted to a small number of cases . \\n this study clearly shows that cti is more prevalent among hiv - infected females ( with or without symptoms of rti ) as compared to hiv - uninfected females . \\n our study also stresses the usefulness of screening asymptomatic hiv - infected and hiv - uninfected females for cti by risk assessment and diagnostic testing periodically to prevent the occurrence of adverse outcomes associated with the disease and also to check further spread of infection in the community . for countries like india that still do not currently have an active chlamydia screening program in place , \\n randomized controlled trials are required to delineate the benefits of screening in the sexually active population as our study participants represent a high risk group . \\n it is also important that any test adopted in a national screening program be used in the primary care setting by practitioners without the need for expensive training and equipment . \\n however , since use of real - time pcr is not feasible in most hospitals in developing countries efforts should be made to develop a simple , cost - effective , sensitive , and specific point of care test to identify and treat women with cti for prevention of sequelae and hiv transmission .\", ' \\n a young man was referred with a chief complaint of blurred vision and pain of the left eye 1 month after herpetic encephalitis in the left frontotemporal lobe . \\n the patient

revealed hsv-2 , so the patient was admitted with the diagnosis of arn and received intravenous acyclovir for 10 days ( 10 mg / kg / day ) . \\n after 48 h of antiviral therapy , a systemic corticosteroid ( prednisolone 1 mg / kg / day ) was introduced and subsequently tapered over several weeks to treat active inflammation . \\n the patient also received aspirin to treat an associated hypercoagulable state . with this treatment , no new lesion developed and opacity of the media decreased ; so prophylactic barrier laser photocoagulation in the areas of healthy retina at the posterior borders of the necrotic lesion prevented retinal detachment . \\n intravitreal antiviral agents such as ganciclovir and foscarnet were not used in this patient because the disease was controlled by intravenous acyclovir . \\n after discharge from hospital , oral acyclovir 400 mg every 5 h was started . during follow - up , \\n the inflammation decreased and the patient had no vitreous traction or retinal detachment or other eye involvement . \\n the brain and retinal involvement were on one side ; after 1 month of left frontotemporal lobe involvement of the brain , the retina was involved on the left side . \\n some of the studies report arn several years after neonatal and infantile herpetic encephalitis [ 5 , 6 ] ; therefore , herpetic encephalitis may be a risk factor for arn development . \\n other articles report that the virus accesses the retina from the brain by the trans - axonal route ; consequently , this virus can cause recurrent episodes of arn [ 8 , 9 ] . these reports may necessitate a prophylaxis with antiviral agents after herpetic encephalitis to prevent arn . in a study by pavsio et al . , the role of long - term prophylaxis with acyclovir in children who had herpetic encephalitis is an important issue . \\n prophylaxis could be considered after hsv encephalitis to prevent arn or after arn to prevent second eye involvement . \\n acyclovir used as prophylaxis for recurrent genital hsv infection in adults for 5 or more years has been associated with minimal toxicity and the selection of resistant strains has not been demonstrated , but there is little experience with the duration of prophylaxis that would have been necessary to prevent arn in our patient . with this report \\n we reemphasize the correlation between these two diseases . on the other hand , arn may be an indication of possible central nervous system involvement and neuroimaging may be necessary in all cases of arn to rule out herpetic encephalitis .', 'an infliction in the life expectancy figure of patients with sickle cell disease ( scd ) occurred around the middle of the 1970s ( fig . \\n this minimal increase in life expectancy coincided with my appointment at thomas jefferson university as the associate director of the newly created adult sickle cell center . \\n the number of adults at that time was small and the transition from pediatrics to adult programs was at the age of 18 years . \\n the trickle of patients increased gradually and we were faced with adolescent and young adult african american patients who were in a state of confusion . \\n stripped from the protective sphere of the pediatric world and the empathy of their pediatric hematologists and the pediatric ancillary staff , they were in a state of fear , anxiety , depression and , worst of all , severe pain . \\n the fact that most patients were barely educated , many without a high school degree , unemployed , mediocre health coverage , and dysfunctional family structure conferred a logarithmic dimension to the problem . \\n the arrow indicates the infliction point where life expectancy of patients with sickle cell disease began to increase . \\n the steady stream of admissions of patients with acute painful vaso - occlusive crises ( vocs ) to the emergency department ( ed ) and hospital were not welcome by most providers , hospital administration , the house and nursing staffs . \\n there was subtle resentment of the patients that sometimes extended to the hematologists who showed compassion to the patients . soon labels such as drug addicts , drug - seeking behavior , and hospital hopping and frequent flyer emerged . \\n listening to and believing the patients and keeping detailed records of ed and hospital admissions and the analgesics prescribed , revealed that most patients genuinely do not respond to a certain analgesic or a certain dose . increasing the doses of an analgesic or switching to another drug solved the problem in most patients . \\n accordingly and with the approval of the institutional review board ( irb ) , i issued an identification wallet - sized , plasticized card that was carried by patients and presented to the provider treating their voc in the ed , hospital or any other medical facility . \\n information printed on both sides of the card included : 1 ) demographic data and a recent photograph ; 2 ) hematological data including reticulocyte count ; 3 ) medical data including the type of scd , its complications and co - morbidities if present ; 4 ) all medications being taken by the patient and the recommended treatment of vocs including the name , dose , and the route of administration of the analgesics in question ; and 5 ) my name and contact information for answering questions if needed . \\n it was not expensive to issue these cards . a polaroid camera available at that time and a laminator were the only equipments needed to issue these cards . \\n later on , information on the card was computerized and a printed copy was given to the patient . \\n the patients were very compliant in carrying it as faithfully as they carry their medical cards . \\n some providers liked it very much because it facilitated having a concise history about the patients . \\n while this controversy was brewing , interesting developments in basic science were in progress to understand the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of opioids . \\n in the 1970s , it was hypothesized that opioids have receptors to bind to and activate in order to relieve pain   by blocking or minimizing the transmission of painful stimuli and raising the pain threshold . \\n it did not take long after that to identify opioids as ligands that bind to stereospecific and saturable receptors in the central nervous system and other tissues [ 3 , 4 ] . \\n in addition , recent elegant studies [ 6 - 10 ] have revealed a helical structure of the opioid receptors , which forms pockets in which the corresponding opioid ( ligand ) fits snugly ( fig . \\n recognition is highly specific , such that only l - isomers of certain opioids exert analgesic activity . \\n physiologically , by binding to receptors , opioids initiate a series of biochemical events including activation of g proteins , inhibition of adenylate cyclase , and extrusion of potassium ions , resulting in hyperpolarization of cell membranes [ 14 - 16 ] ; this delays or prevents transmission of painful stimuli . \\n thus , the riddle why some patients respond to one opioid but not another had a pathophysiologic explanation . \\n ( a ) morphine - like molecule ( yellow ) in the deep pocket ( blue ) of the -opioid receptor . ( b ) \\n -opioid receptors from an intimate pair when crystallized with a ligand ( yellow ) such as morphine . knowing how an opioid molecule ( yellow ) sticks in the pocket of its receptor ( blue ) \\n parallel to the progress in the pharmacodynamics of opioids mentioned above , a concomitant advance in the pharmacokinetics of opioids was bubbling to the surface . \\n phase i involves the cyp enzymes and phase ii metabolism conjugates the drug to hydrophilic substances , such as glucuronic acid , sulfate , glycine , or glutathione . \\n morphine , hydromorphone and oxymorphone are metabolized by glucuronidation , whereas the majority of the other opioids are metabolized by the cytochrome p450 isoenzyme system . \\n the net effect of an opioid depends on the availability of enzyme(s ) to convert it into metabolites that could be active or inactive . \\n briefly , the cyp2d6 genotypes are categorized into phenotypes based on the activity of the variant enzymes . \\n ultrarapid metabolizers ( ums ) have greater than normal activity due to duplication or triplication , of active alleles [ 20 - 23 ] , extensive metabolizers ( ems ) have normal enzyme activity , intermediate metabolizers ( ims ) have decreased enzyme activity , and poor metabolizers ( pms ) have absent or little enzyme activity . \\n patients who are ums of fentanyl would rapidly convert it into inactive metabolites with minimal or absent analgesic effect requiring increasing the dose of fentanyl . \\n on the other hand , patients who are pms of fentanyl would experience prompt relief with relatively small doses of fentanyl but higher doses could be toxic due to the accumulation of unmetabolized fentanyl . \\n the cyp3a4 enzyme metabolizes more than 50% of all drugs ; consequently , opioids metabolized by this enzyme have a high risk of drug - drug interactions . \\n together , current data on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of opioids show great variability of genotypes among patients and extreme variability in individual responses to opioids . determining the pharmacogenetics profile of each patient \\n facilitates the choice of drugs that would be efficacious for that patient and avoid those drugs associated with harmful drug - drug interaction . \\n this approach in diagnostics and therapeutics ushers in the dawn of a new field for the management of individual patients based on their unique pharmacogenetics , phenotypic and biomarker characteristics . \\n this future approach is referred to as personalized medicine or , more recently , precision medicine . \\n we hope that this methodology would be approved and sponsored by the insurance companies for patients with scd . in the meantime , listening , believing and respecting the patient with sickle cell pain should be maintained for now as the approach to individualized therapy . \\n ', \"sevoflurane does not sensitise the myocardium to arrhythmogenic effects

hypertension , \\n isravd was recorded during induction of anaesthesia with sevoflurane which reverted back to sinus rhythm after discontinuation of sevoflurane during emergence . \\n 2 pacemakers ( sinus and av nodes ) fortuitously discharge at the same or nearly similar rate , without antegrade or retrograde conduction across the av node . \\n either slowing of the sinus node discharge rate or the emergence of a slightly faster subsidiary pacemaker controlling the ventricles is the common initiating event . \\n p waves approaches the narrow qrs complex , disappears within it for several beats , then reappears and recedes from the qrs and this sequence may be repeated . \\n the same was observed in the ecg recording in the present case [ figure 1 ] . from the limited number of experimental studies , the development of isravd and the particular electrocardiographic patterns resulting from \\n there are dependent upon relative discharge rate of the dominant atrial and subsidiary pacemakers , presence or absence of retrograde conduction , chronotropic response to atrial stretch , baroreceptor - mediated autonomic nervous system output and responsiveness of the sinus node . \\n high incidence of nodal rhythm ( 20% ) and bradycardia with use of sevoflurane has been reported in unpremedicated infants . \\n the onset of nodal rhythm was significantly earlier in the high - concentration technique than with incremental induction technique . \\n on the other hand , nakaigawa et al . demonstrated that up to 2 mac ( minimal alveolar concentration ) sevoflurane does not affect cardiac conduction system significantly . in both our patients , 8% sevoflurane was used for induction that possibly resulted in isravd and junctional rhythm . \\n isravd was possibly precipitated by the volatile agent affecting ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum , resulting in depression of ca slow inward current in the myocardium . in patients on ca channel and -adrenergic blocker therapy , \\n the arrhythmogenic potential of sevoflurane is likely to be enhanced as ca channel blockers inhibit the entry of ca into the cell or its mobilisation from intracellular stores , while b - adrenergic blockers depresses sinus rate and av node conduction . \\n reported a case of intraoperative torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation during sevoflurane anaesthesia , which persisted with dc shock but reverted to sinus rhythm after 10 minutes of discontinuation of sevoflurane and after the patient was awakened . \\n a discrepancy was observed between the hr and the pr due to intermittent electrical alternans in the ecg . \\n it is therefore wise to rely on the pr rather than the hr in such cases to treat bradycardia . \\n rarely , sevoflurane - induced suppression of baroreceptor reflex activity might result in desynchronisation between the atria and ventricle causing haemodynamic instability which may require electrical pacing . \\n to conclude , sevoflurane in high concentration ( 8% ) should be used with caution in children and in conditions where primary pacemaker activity is suppressed , as in elderly . \\n caution should also be exercised with its use in patients on ca channel and b blocker therapy .\", \"type iii dysbetalipoproteinaemia is a kind of lipid metabolism disorders , caused by apo - e deficiency , which leads to accumulation of chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein remnants in the plasma.123 lipid metabolism disorders are mostly manifested by xanthomas , which are known as yellowish cholesterol - rich material in large foam cells accumulating in the skins and tendons.14 these yellowish lesions may appear all over the body , on the palm of the hands , sole of the foot , tendons , and even on the eyelids.5 these lesions firstly described with or without hyperlipidaemia in association with monoclonal immunoglobulin . based on this fact , there are three forms of xanthoma : hyperlipaemic xanthoma , normolipaemic xanthoma and necrobiotic xanthogranuloma.6 xanthomatosis is usually associated with hyperlipidaemia , and morbidity and mortality of this condition are related to atherosclerosis and pancreatitis.7 hyperlipaemic xanthoma lesions are more polymorphic and can include tuberous , tendinous , palmar or eruptive xanthoma . \\n verruciform xanthoma usually presents as a hyperkeratotic , cauliflower like , verrucous or papillomatous lesion.6 it initially was described as a unique clinicopathologic lesion of the oral mucosa and was subsequently reported in the skin . \\n the epidermal - mucosal changes of hyperparakeratosis , neutrophilic infiltrate and dermal - submucosal foam cell reaction are distinctive features of these xanthomas.8 hereby , we present a rare type of xanthomas calling  cauliflower xanthoma  in a 43-year - old man with dysbetalipoproteinaemia . \\n a 43-year - old man was presented to outpatient endocrine clinic of tabriz university of medical sciences , tabriz , iran , by his sister for evaluation of skin lesions . \\n he had multiple lesions on shoulders and back , lateral and medial part of dorsal surface of the foot , medial and lateral malleus of both feet , and dorsal and palmar surface of both hands . \\n siblings of the patient have been followed up in that clinic for clinically diagnosed type - iii dysbetalipoproteinaemia . \\n this diagnosis was based on characteristic palmar , eruptive , tuberous and trauma site xanthomas with typical high levels of both total cholesterol and triglycerides in the plasma . \\n history of coronary artery or other atherosclerotic disorders were negative in index case and siblings . \\n there were not any other complaint , and as a greengrocer , he had an active lifestyle . \\n he had a pathology report of skin lesion biopsy that was performed by a dermatologist few months ago , with presence of lipid laden macrophages consistent with diagnosis of xanthoma . fasting serum lipid levels reported as : total cholesterol = 507 mg / dl , triglycerides = 470 mg / dl and high density lipoprotein ( hdl ) cholesterol = 41 mg / dl . \\n he had normal fasting blood sugar , and normal thyroid , renal and liver function tests . \\n physical examinations revealed numerous xanthomas resembling cauliflower on both knees [ figure 1 ] , unusual eruptive , tuberous xanthomas same as previous lesions , on the lateral malleus of both feet [ figure 2 ] . \\n cauliflower xanthomas on the knees and lateral malleus of both lower extremities cauliflower xanthomas on the lateral malleus of lower extremities there were lots of smaller xanthomas on the right shoulder [ figure 3 ] , and cauliflower like xanthomas on the extensor side of the left upper extremity , especially on the elbow [ figure 4 ] . based on available information \\n , the patient diagnosed as familial dysbetalipoproteinaemia ( fdl ) and the unique lesions on the lower limb called  cauliflower xanthoma  . \\n although siblings of this case had the same disorder , they did nt develop such lesions . \\n xanthomas on the shoulder and back of the neck xanthomas on the extensor side of the hand by searching in the medical data bases , we can not find a previous such a lesion . therefore , we decided to present this case without revealing patient 's name , after taking his consent . \\n considering the fact that the treatment with high dose statin was effective in correction of lipid abnormality and regression of skin lesions in his three siblings , we wanted to try the treatment procedure in this patient but he refused any intervention . \\n fdl , also known as hyperlipoproteinemia type - iii or broad beta disease , is a rare inherited disorder characterised by improper metabolism of certain lipids , specially plasma cholesterol , triglyceride rich chylomicron and very low density lipoproteins ( vldl ) remnants.1 presence or absence of the symptoms of this disease depends on two major risk factors : genetic and diet.910 mutations in the gene for apolipoprotein e ( apo e ) are the main cause of this disease . \\n replacement of an arginine by a cysteine in position 158 of the 299-amino acid chain of apo e5 is responsible for the defective binding of chylomicron and vldl remnants to cell receptors . \\n thereafter , slower plasma clearance of these particles occurs , and results in the abnormal accumulation of lipids in the body.9 on the other side , diet has an essential role in the development of the disease . \\n this means that with standard cholesterol diet , symptoms of fdl will not appear , even in the genetically susceptible person.10 xanthomas can be a symptom of fdl . \\n xanthomas may also be the symptoms of a generalised histiocytosis , or a local fat phagocytosing storage process.11 they are yellowish lesions on the skins and tendons , macroscopically . \\n these macrophages are filled with lipid droplets , which are dissolved and removed from tissue during histologic processing.8 fdl is mostly diagnosed by combination of clinical and laboratory findings.12 most cases are inherited as autosomal recessive trait . \\n men are more susceptible for fdl probably because of protective impact of estrogen in women . \\n most of the diagnosed patients were typically young males , with strong family history , characteristic skin lesions , high serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides and confirming skin histology.113 most of these cases have premature atherosclerosis and other signs of ischaemic disorders.9 the patient in this article was a middle aged man with family history of dysbetalipoproteinaemia and high levels of serum lipids as follows : total cholesterol = 507 mg / dl and triglycerides = 470 mg / dl . \\n he had a rare form of xanthoma all over his body , causing social problems for him . \\n nicotinic acid , clofibrate , statins or gemfibrozil properly reduce cholesterol and triglycerides in people affected with dysbetalipoproteinaemia.1 the patient mentioned in this article refused receiving any medical intervention . \\n he has just been advised to have low lipid diet , fish oil and regular moderate exercise in order to reducing serum lipid levels . \\n there should be distinctive monitoring of fdl patients including regular checking of their serum lipids . \\n controlling underlying disorders , and reducing excess calories , saturated fat and cholesterol , is the main aim of treating these patients . according to this article \\n , cauliflower xanthomas could be a symptom of fdl , and it should be considered as a differential diagnosis while approaching to these lesions .\", \"lipoma is a rare tumor but can be found at various

national cancer institute ( nci ) of the united states of america has proposed a reporting system for thyroid fine needle aspiration ( fna ) cytology , so - called bethesda system , which became an international standard of thyroid cytology [ 1 , 2 ] . following this recommendation , the uk royal college of pathologists ( the uk system ) [ 3 , 4 ] and italian societies of endocrinology and the italian society for anatomic pathology and cytology joint with the italian division of the international academy of pathology ( the italian system ) [ 5 , 6 ] updated their diagnostic schema comparable with the bethesda system . in 2013 , \\n the japan thyroid association ( jta ) published guidelines for clinical practice for the management of thyroid nodules , including its diagnostic system for reporting thyroid fna cytology as shown in table 1 [ 79 ] , using criteria similar to those used in the papanicolaou society recommendation , the bethesda system [ 1 , 2 ] , the uk system [ 3 , 4 ] , and the italian system [ 5 , 6 ] . \\n the jta reporting system of thyroid cytology further recommends risk stratification of follicular neoplasms ( fn ) into favor benign ( low risk : lr ) , borderline ( moderate risk : mr ) , and favor malignant ( high risk : hr ) , which was adopted from the practice of high - volume thyroid centers in japan . \\n this study examined observer variation in the subclassification of fn among 4 thyroid experts to validate the usefulness and limitations of this characteristic risk stratification of fn recommended in the jta guidelines . \\n it is not our purpose to address in detail all the morphological issues of thyroid cytology . \\n conventional smear samples of indeterminate diagnosis ( n = 389 ) were selected from files ( n = 3843 ) from the year 2005 at ito hospital , tokyo , japan , by one ( k. kameyama ) of the authors . \\n inadequate samples or those with poor preparation and cases under clinical follow - up ( no final histologic diagnosis ) were excluded . \\n there were 91 ( 23.4% ) surgically treated patients with thyroid nodule under indeterminate cytological diagnoses . \\n these patients visited ito hospital in 2005 and underwent diagnostic surgery or curative surgery in the subsequent years between 2005 and 2008 . \\n there were 48 cases of benign diagnoses , including 29 follicular adenomas ( fas ) , 19 adenomatous nodules ( an ) , and 43 malignant diagnoses , including 13 follicular carcinomas ( ftcs ) , 24 papillary carcinomas ( ptcs ) , 1 poorly differentiated carcinoma , 2 c - cell carcinomas , and 3 malignant lymphomas . \\n twenty cases of cytological smear samples with follicular patterned lesions were randomly selected by one ( k. kameyama ) of the authors and they were further analyzed for subclassification of fn and diagnoses by 4 reviewers , as shown in table 2 . \\n the present study is a reproducibility study undertaken by 4 reviewers ( kennichi kakudo , kaori kameyama , mitsuyoshi hirokawa , and ryohei katoh ) who have special interest in thyroid pathology , all of whom are members of the clinical guideline committee of the jta . \\n they were requested to subclassify fn following the new jta reporting system of thyroid cytology as shown in table 1 . \\n those 20 cases of smear samples ( one representative smear sample each stained by the papanicolaou method ) were circulated among the 4 reviewers without clinical information . \\n the 4 reviewers examined cytological samples independently without exchanging opinions and were unaware of the original cytological diagnoses and final histologic diagnoses . because this study was conceived as an audit of cytology performance and the results are anonymized , institutional ethical committee permission was not required for its conduct . \\n informed consent of all 4 reviewers was obtained for this study protocol . for statistical analysis of observer concordance ,  was first introduced as a measure of the level of agreement between pairs of raters and extended to multiple raters , known as composite  [ 11 , 12 ] . \\n composite  statistical analysis was performed by using data analysis and statistical software , version 13 ( stata press , college station , texas , usa ) . \\n values of  can be interpreted as follows : 0.000.20 , slight or very weak agreement ; 0.210.40 , weak to fair agreement ; 0.410.60 , moderate agreement ; 0.610.80 , substantial or good agreement ; and values over 0.81 , optimal or almost perfect agreement . \\n there were 8 malignant cases ( 2 ftcs , widely invasive ; 4 ftcs , minimally invasive ; and 2 ptcs ) and 12 benign cases ( 1 an and 11 fas ) . \\n all diagnoses made by the 4 reviewers on the 20 follicular pattern lesions are shown in table 2 . \\n there were only 6 ( 30% ) cases with a consensus diagnosis among all 4 of the reviewers : 3 in fa and 3 in ftc . \\n diagnoses of fn and hr were made in only 7 cases ( 35% ) , including 4 malignant and 3 benign cases . \\n composite  statistical analysis clearly demonstrated good concordance for the hr diagnosis in malignant cases (  = 0.7714 ) ( table 3 ) , while this was not found for the other subcategories in both benign and malignant lesions (  < 0.4 ) . \\n it is of note that there was no interobserver variation in ftcs , widely invasive ( n = 2 ) , and all 4 reviewers classified the 2 cases into the hr subcategory . \\n it is clear that ftcs , widely invasive , have different degrees of cellular abnormality in our study . \\n in contrast , there were significant disagreements among other types of malignancy and benign lesions , which clearly confirmed that the subclassification of fn is not a definite diagnosis but risk stratification useful for triage patients . \\n concerning ftc , minimally invasive ( n = 4 ) , there was only one concordant case among the 4 reviewers and all reviewers made a mr diagnosis in 1 case . \\n there were disagreements between mr and hr in 1 case and between lr and mr in 2 cases . \\n as for ptc ( n = 2 ) , the 4 reviewers gave 2 diagnoses each , which included 3 lrs , 3 mrs , 1 hr , and 1 suspicious for ptc . \\n however , it is of note that there was no single case in our 20 cases whose subclassification varied among all 3 subcategories . in benign final histologic diagnosis ( n = 12 ) , there were 9 split diagnoses , including 6 cases between lr and mr and 3 cases between mr and hr , but no case between lr and hr . \\n the incidence of lr diagnoses by the 4 reviewers in the 12 benign lesions was 31.3% ( 15/48 ) and that of lr diagnoses in the 6 cases of ftc was 16.7% ( 4/24 ) ( p = 0.186 ) . \\n the incidence of hr diagnosis in the 12 benign lesions was 10.4% ( 5/48 ) and that of hr in the 6 cases of ftc was 47.1% ( 10/24 ) ( p = 0.002 ) . \\n the incidence of malignancy of the hr was high at 60% for reviewer a , 75% for b , 75% for c , and 75% for d ( 6075% ) . \\n the incidence of malignancy in the mr was lower than that of hr and was 33.3% for reviewer a , 35.7% for reviewer b , 25% for c , and 30.8% for d ( 2535.7% ) . \\n the incidence of malignancy in the lr was lower than that in the hr and was 33.3% for reviewer a , 0% for b , 37.5% for c , and 33.3% for d ( 037.5% ) . \\n although the risks of malignancy in the subcategories of fn differed among the 4 reviewers , it is of note that hr cytological diagnosis was significantly correlated with malignant histological diagnosis , and the risk of malignancy ( 6075% ) was significantly higher than that in the other 2 subcategories ( 035.7% ) in our study ( p = 0.002 ) . \\n although the standardization of terminology and diagnostic criteria is important for accurate communication among patients , clinical doctors , and cytopathologists [ 110 ] , there are still differences among reporting systems in thyroid cytology as to how to interpret cytological diagnoses and how to decide on the clinical management of patients . in japan , cytopathologists attempted to use an internationally accepted reporting system , but it had to be modified to fit our practice . in japan , all patients with indeterminate cytology undergo further diagnostic procedures , without immediate surgery , to search for higher risk patients who should undergo surgery [ 79 , 1315 ] . \\n it is because the majority of thyroid carcinomas in indeterminate cytology are indolent and more conservative approaches , other than immediate diagnostic surgery , usually do not create any harm to the patient with malignancy [ 1620 ] and diagnostic surgery to all patients with indeterminate cytology results in risks of unnecessary surgery to the patients with benign nodules , more than 80% of the patients [ 79 , 1922 ] . \\n the proportion of malignancy found at thyroidectomy from patients with indeterminate cytology in this clinical setting will increase in number , and the malignancy rate of patient with indeterminate cytology in our study was calculated as 47.3% as shown in materials and methods . \\n takezawa et al . from japan retrospectively analyzed their 1606 cytological samples using bethesda system , although it was written in japanese with english abstract , and they identified 115 ( 7.9% ) cases of aus / flus ( atypia of undetermined significance / follicular lesions of undetermined significance ) and 61 ( 4.2% ) cases of fn / sfn ( follicular neoplasms / suspicious for follicular neoplasms ) . \\n the resection rate of their aus / flus nodules was 30.4% ( 35/115 cases ) and its malignancy rate was 88.6% ( 31/35 cases ) , and the resection rate of fn / sfn nodules was 36.0% ( 22/61 cases ) and its malignancy rate was 72.4% ( 16/22 cases ) , which were very different from the ranges reported in most of the literatures from western countries using the bethesda system or the uk system [ 1 , 2 , 2023 ] . as it is clear , further triage of patients with indeterminate nodules reduces resection rates and increases malignancy rates in any diagnostic systems including the bethesda system . \\n this clinical management was also true in some other countries [ 2427 ] , as crippa and dina commented in a letter to an editor that thyroid cytology is the most important but not the only important deciding factor and therefore it must be integrated with other diagnostic procedures . \\n we propose that future thyroid cytology classification schemes should reconsider clinical managements of indeterminate categories and how to reduce unnecessary surgeries for patients with benign thyroid nodules [ 79 ] . \\n the risk stratification of follicular pattern lesions into 3 subcategories ( cellular follicular lesion , fn favor benign , and fn favor malignant ) was suggested by the papanicolaou society in 1996 , but it did not become popular in thyroid cytology worldwide , apart from japan [ 8 , 9 ] . there have been some reports in the literature on risk stratification of fn [ 10 , 2834 ] . \\n kelman et al . reported that 31/52 ( 60% ) nodules with nuclear atypia consistent with fn were malignant   and it was 4/9 ( 44.4% ) in fn with atypia by goldstein et al . . \\n reported that atypical proliferation was more often malignant than follicular group ( 53% versus 19% ) in their indeterminate category ( tir3/thy3 ) . \\n some researchers pointed out that the malignancy rate of fn without atypia is low and assessment later on could be an alternative approach [ 31 , 32 ] and patients with high - risk cytological features such as nuclear overlapping ( crowding ) should be advised to have a surgical intervention [ 3133 ] . \\n gerhard and da cunha santos using the papanicolaou society guidelines studied reproducibility between 2 observers in 97 diagnoses . \\n they reported a substantial level of diagnostic interobserver (  = 0.71 ) and intraobserver (  = 0.66 ) reproducibility , although interobserver disagreement in the cytological diagnosis occurred in 23 cases ( 24.7% ) and 18 ( 41.7% ) of them were for fn . \\n in an interobserver reproducibility study using the uk system , kocjan et al . reported that the  statistic was very poor ( 0.11 ) for the thy3a category and that for thy4 was 0.17 , in contrast to moderate to good agreement for thy1 ( 0.69 ) , thy2 ( 0.55 ) , thy3f ( 0.51 ) , and thy5 ( 0.61 ) . \\n the observer variation of fn in our study occurred more often between lr and mr ( 9 cases , 45% ) , followed by between mr and hr ( 5 cases , 25% ) , but it is remarkable to note that none occurred between lr and hr . in other words , discordance is limited to between lr and mr or mr and hr , so we may conclude that the mr subcategory has an essential role in minimizing discordance between lr and hr . \\n another choice of subclassification of follicular neoplasms would be two categories ( low cancer risk and high cancer risk )   instead of three categories ( lr , mr , and hr ) , and this modification ( two categories ) is also described as acceptable in the reporting system recommended by the japan thyroid association [ 7 , 8 ] . \\n the second conclusion we may draw is that hr in the jta system is a powerful cytological subcategory to be used for the triage of patients for diagnostic surgery because the risk of malignancy of hr is high ( 6075% ) equivalent to suspicious for malignancy category in the bethesda system , with good concordance among the 4 reviewers (  = 0.7714 ) . \\n abele and levine reported their rate of indeterminate category to be 5% of 51,000 adequate fnas and they suggested that the national rate of 15% was in large part due to overdiagnosis . this significant difference in ratio of indeterminate categories may be due to experience of thyroid cytology and not patients ' background . \\n clary et al . commented in their interobserver variability study that some pathologists make greater use of indeterminate categories such as follicular lesion , favor nonneoplastic or follicular lesion , and favor neoplastic lesion , whereas others show more definitive categorization into benign and neoplastic groups . \\n cibas et al . also stated in their report on interobserver variability that cytopathologists with experience of thyroid cytopathology are more likely to make a definitive interpretation ( i.e. , benign or malignant ) . \\n this tendency was seen in our present study in which reviewers b and d ( whose indeterminate diagnosis rates are about 15% in their practice ) made mr diagnosis more often ( 70% and 65% , resp . ) and lr diagnosis less frequently ( 10% and 15% , resp . ) than those of reviewers a and c ( whose indeterminate diagnosis rates are about 5% in their practice ) . \\n the difference in the prevalence of benign and fn / sfn may explain the different rates of lr ( low risk ) and mr ( moderate risk ) among reviews in our study , because incidence of one category may expand or contract depending on the rates of other categories . \\n some fn / sfn lesions with benign pattern would be classified as benign by different authors and the incidence of fn / sfn of bethesda system in recent 7 series varied from 1.5 to 9.7% and that of benign category was between 54 and 77.4% summarized by ohori and schoedel . \\n rapid development of molecular analyses on thyroid cytology may lead us possibly in the near future to more accurately identify patients who should be referred to surgery . until that time comes \\n , thyroid fna cytology remains a main stay in the management of patients with thyroid nodules integrated with other clinical tests , such as ultrasound image diagnosis . as a conclusion \\n the hr subcategory has a high predictive value of malignancy and good agreement among the 4 reviewers which is clinically helpful to triage patients for surgery . \\n we believe that patients with cytological diagnosis of hr subcategory of fn in the jta system should be surgically treated especially if other risk factors coexisted . on the other hand , patients with lr or mr category \\n therefore , surgical resection rate of indeterminate category is low in japan usually less than 50% , particularly in cases with fn .\", \"genomic dna hypomethylation has been observed in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of leukemia patients and in tumor cells of patients with b - cell lymphoproliferative diseases ( 1 ) . \\n dna methylation may affect karyotypic stability , may influence euchromatin - heterochromatin interactions , and has been correlated with disease progression ( 2 ) . on the other hand , \\n for example , some patients with lymphomas do not express tumor suppressor genes because the promoters of these genes are methylated . \\n , bone marrow produces a large number of abnormal white blood cells , which overwhelm the other types of blood cells , including red blood cells and platelets , thus impairing the production of normal white blood cells . in clinical classification , leukemia can be classified as acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) and chronic myeloid leukemia ( cml ) . \\n cml is a clonal disease of stem cell origin that is characterized by the presence of the philadelphia chromosome ( ph+ ) , which has been named t(9,22)(q34:q11 ) . \\n its fusion gene product , bcr - abl , is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase . \\n nevertheless , the differential factors through which they produce a different type of leukemia are not yet completely understood . in hematopoietic malignancies , \\n hypermethylation of several genes including e - cadherin , dap

genes were found to be methylated in bone marrow from patients with aml or cml . specifically , the frequencies of promoter hypermethylation at selected locus in the 23 aml samples were : 78.3% ( 18/23 ) for shp1 , 65.2% ( 15/23 ) for id4 and sfrp1 , 26.1% ( 6/23 ) for h - cadherin , 8.7% ( 2/23 ) for dlc-1 , and 4.3% ( 1/23 ) for dab2ip and runx3 . \\n the frequencies of dna hypermethylation at selected locus in the 21 cml samples were : 28.6% ( 6/21 ) for shp1 , 19.0% ( 4/21 ) for h - cadherin , 14.3% ( 3/21 ) for id4 , 9.5% for ( 2/21 ) for sfrp1 , and 0% ( 0/21 ) for dab2ip , dlc-1 , integrin 4 , and runx3 ( fig . \\n however , promoter hypermethylation of the 22 normal peripheral bloods was observed less frequently ( table 2 ) . there was a statistically significant difference between normal peripheral bloods and aml with respect to the frequencies of methylation of id4 , sfrp1 , and shp1 ( pearson chi - square test ; p<0.0001 , p<0.0001 , and p<0.0001 , respectively ) and between normal peripheral bloods and cml with respect to the frequencies of shp1 methylation ( pearson chi - square test ; p=0.007 ) \\n . furthermore , there was a statistically significant difference between the dna methylation frequencies of aml patients and cml patients . \\n the frequencies of dna methylation of id4 , sfrp1 , and shp1 were higher in aml compared to those in cml ( p=0.001 , p<0.0001 , and p=0.001 , respectively ) ( table 2 ) . \\n in contrast , no statistical differences between aml and cml were detected in other genes such as dlc-1 , dab2ip , h - cadherin , integrin 4 , and runx3 . \\n promoter methylation results at selected locus of eight genes with msp method were shown in fig . \\n the results of the present study demonstrate the substantially increased frequency of promoter hypermethylation in id4 , sfrp1 , and shp1 genes in aml compared to cml . \\n leukemia , a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic malignancies that occur worldwide , includes acute and chronic myeloid leukemia . despite many important advances in understanding the different biological and cytogenetic aspects of acute and chronic leukemia , \\n it is understood that some kinds of leukemia present specific cytogenetic alterations ( 21 ) . \\n different types of leukemia usually have specific epigenetic modifications that cause the activation of oncogenes and , in particular , the formation of abnormal fusion genes such as aml1-eto ( 22 , 23 ) , a fusion protein resulting from t(8,21 ) translocation that commonly occurs in aml . \\n another typical example is the fact that bcr - abl is a constitutively active , cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that is generated by t(9;22 ) translocation in more than 95% of cml ( 24 ) . \\n the central role of epigenetic modification of these genes in leukemia development promoted them as reasonable targets for understanding the differential mechanism between acute and chronic leukemia . in the present study , id4 , sfrp1 , and ship1 \\n these results suggest that the epigenetic modification of these genes may play specific roles in the development of aml rather than cml and , thus , promoted them as ideal targets for drug development to treat aml . in the future , it is clearly imperative to understand the patho - physiological differential mechanisms of these genes in aml , and to finally explore novel therapeutic strategies . in present study , \\n methylation frequencies of shp1 gene were the high detected in cml as well as aml . \\n shp1 is a member of the shp family of proteins , cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase ( ptp ) , and has been known as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in lymphoma , leukemia and other cancers ( 25 ) . \\n also , the hypermethylation of shp1 gene was frequently detected in several human cancers and the reduced expression of the shp1 gene in various types of leukemias and lymphomas mainly occurred by promoter methylation ( 26 - 28 ) . therefore , these results indicate that aberrant dna methylation of shp1 gene may be related to the tumorigenicity of myeloid leukemia . \\n the methylation frequencies of the dab2ip , dlc-1 , and runx3 genes were detected at different levels in acute and chronic leukemia patients ; however , the difference was negligible . in some genes like integrin 4 gene , \\n however , hypermethylation of these genes was frequent event in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas , lung cancers , and gastric cancers ( 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 ) . \\n thus , dna methylation of these genes may be not related to tumorigenicity of aml / cml in contrast with other cancers . in summary , we have identified that aberrant dna methylation of shp1 is a frequent event in aml and cml . also , the frequencies of dna methylation of several methylation - controlled genes , including id4 , sfrp1 , and shp1 , were higher in aml patients compared to those in cml patients . \\n although these results should be confirmed , more comprehensive studies are necessary involving various known risk factors such as smoking and occupational carcinogens , and genetic susceptibilities . \\n our results suggest that aberrant dna methylation of shp1 may be related to the tumorigenicity of aml and cml and hypermethylation of id4 , sfrp1 , and shp1 genes may contribute to the pathogenesis mechanism of aml specifically .\", 'acute patellar dislocation is a common injury usually associated with a significant traumatic mechanism resulting in lateral displacement . \\n vertical axis rotation following dislocation is a rare variant of this type of injury and can prevent closed reduction in the acute setting . \\n a 32-year old gentleman presented with an irreducible patella dislocation following an unusual atraumatic mechanism . following attempts at closed reduction under sedation and regional nerve block , eventual open reduction and soft tissue reconstruction was required under general anesthetic . during the open reduction procedure , it was noted that the patella had dislocated into a lateral extra - articular position and rotated around its vertical axis . \\n a review of the literature suggests dislocations such as the current presentation , are extremely rare and although have been described to occur with minor trauma , have never been described to occur following a largely atraumatic event . in such cases , \\n closed reduction may be impossible even with adequate analgesia due to patella position and soft tissue obstruction . \\n acute patellar dislocation is defined as the abrupt disruption in the relationship of the patella within the femoral groove . \\n patellar dislocation is a relatively common occurrence and is usually managed in the emergency department with closed manipulation under sedation . \\n however , when the patella itself rotates around its vertical axis during dislocation , surgical intervention is usually required . \\n a 32-year old gentleman was admitted to our trauma department with a painful , immobile right knee . \\n he sustained the injury externally rotating his knee whilst in  slight flexion  while he was moving from the driver s seat to the passenger s seat of his car . \\n the first event was 15 years prior , when his knee twisted in flexed position while pushing a car . \\n the second event was four years prior , when he sustained an injury while pushing a van , this time with the right knee fully extended . on this occasion , \\n our patient had no other significant past medical or surgical history and explained his right knee was completely asymptomatic prior to this current event . on examination \\n , there was an obvious deformity suggesting lateral displacement of the patella with a sulcus in the skin evident over the femoral groove . \\n furthermore , the knee was held fixed in 15 degrees of flexion . due to patient positioning difficulties we were unable to obtain true ap and lateral views on x - ray . \\n the radiographs demonstrated a laterally displaced and a mal - rotated patella in the vertical plane ( see figs . 1 and 2 ) . \\n lateral radiograph of the right knee demonstrating rotation of patella our patient was subsequently taken to theatre where one final attempt of closed reduction was carried out under general anaesthetic and muscle relaxation . ultimately , this failed and an open reduction was performed . \\n complete rupture of the medial patellofemoral ligament ( mpfl ) was identified with the patella situated lateral to the lateral femoral condyle , everted by approximately 100 degrees . \\n the knee joint was washed out with normal saline and the medial patella retinaculum was repaired . after the repair , \\n post - operative radiographs confirm the patella in a satisfactory position in the antero - posterior and lateral planes ( see figs . 3 and 4 ) . \\n the patient was placed in an extension splint for comfort purposes immediately post - operatively . \\n early mobilization was encouraged after 5 days and the patient was referred for early physiotherapy . at 3 months follow - up , our patient had no further episodes of dislocation , full range of knee extension and flexion , and normal patella tracking . \\n a hypermobility assessment at this stage revealed a beighton score of 2 with extension beyond 10 degrees of both elbows only . \\n intraoperative antero - posterior florous copy image following successful reduction lateral radiograph of the right knee following surgery in knee splint \\n patellar dislocations can vary widely in their pattern of presentation however vertical axis rotation complicates only a small number of these cases . in 1844 , cooper described the earliest case of patellar dislocation with vertical axis rotation . \\n since then , only a handful of case reports describing vertical axis rotation of the patella have been published with the majority describing the location of the patella within the femoral trochlea ( intra - articular ) [ 2 - 11 ] . our case is rare as our patient had a less common variant of extra - articular patellar dislocation complicated by vertical axis rotation and by the fact , that the causative mechanism was largely atraumatic . \\n previous descriptions postulate that the prominence of the lateral femoral condyle acts as a pivot point , which can cause the patella to rotate around on its vertical axis . in this case , however , the patient denies any trauma , and instead describes externally rotating the leg whilst extended as the mechanism of injury . \\n it is almost certain that the previous dislocations in our patient s case had resulted in significant damage of the mpfl . with the patient reporting his injury taking place with the knee  slightly  flexed , the function of the mpfl in this case as the primary medial restraint during the first 20 degrees of flexion was likely to be inadequate . \\n previous authors have described similar cases of extra - articular lateral patellar dislocation with vertical axis rotation and have noted in their subsequent reviews of the limited literature that intra - aritcular dislocations were usually related to far more significant trauma than extra - articular dislocations [ 3 - 10 ] . \\n this was also the finding in a previous report highlighting the relative minor force resulting in an extra - articular dislocation . \\n we feel this may be an indication of the chronic deficiency in the mpfl likely contributing to cases of extra - articular dislocation . on reviewing the previous cases of extra - articular dislocation in the literature \\n , none had described a completely atraumatic mechanism and none had discussed previous dislocations or previous surgical history in their patients . \\n detailed imaging can be difficult to obtain in the acute scenario ; however in these cases ct imaging may clarify patella position and demonstrate mechanical engagement of the patella on the lateral femoral condyle . \\n in one case report , ct imaging was utilized and confirmed avulsions of the vastusmedialis muscle and medial crus of the patella tendon with resultant impaction of the medial border on the patella onto the lateral femoral condyle . in this case , imaging led to the decision for open reduction being required , minimizing further attempts at closed reduction which could in theory result in further damage . \\n it is difficult to be absolutely sure why attempts at closed reduction had failed in our particular case , but this is likely to be multifactorial . \\n vertical axis rotation results in impaction of the lateral edge of the patella on the lateral femoral epicondyle which may result in a corresponding femoral defect resulting in a lodging effect . furthermore patient factors , namely obesity and large muscle mass around the knee made manipulation technically difficult in our case . \\n open reduction under general anaesthetic is rarely necessary for routine patellar dislocations however there are some obvious advantages . \\n these include ; the possibility of direct visualisation of the obvious damage to the soft tissue structures contributing to or resultant from the dislocation . in our case it was likely \\n the mpfl had been damaged previously and repair is likely to help in restoring central patella tracking and overall stability . in this case , the patient was noted as having a shallow trochlea which might have accounted for his increased tendency to dislocations . \\n direct visual inspection may also help determine patients who are at risk of recurrent dislocations due to factors relating to their bony morphology and allow the surgeon to plan further management accordingly . \\n lastly , visualisation of the articulating surfaces allows the surgeon to identify and address any osteochondral defects and corresponding loose bodies which may otherwise have contributed to long term future problems requiring eventual surgical intervention . \\n from our experience with this case , difficulty in reducing a dislocated patella should alert surgeons to the possibility of an extra - articular dislocation with possible vertical axis rotation . in these scenarios , multiple attempts at reduction \\n we were able to achieve adequate analgesia and sedation using local and regional anaesthesia , without successful reduction of the dislocation . \\n although some authors have demonstrated successful closed reduction with the use of local anaesthetic and muscle relaxants , this is not always effective . furthermore , attempted closed reduction under general anaesthesia in our case was also unsuccessful , demonstrating how closed reduction can be futile in certain cases . \\n we would recommend a low threshold for open reduction in such cases by a specialist knee surgeon who may assess and reconstruct damaged soft tissue damage in one operation vertical axis rotation is a rare entity complicating patella dislocations . in this rare event \\n emergency physicians should be aware of this complication and refer to the relevant specialist for open reduction under general anaesthesia in order to minimize patient discomfort and potential articular surface damage .', 'graphene oxide ( go ) solution was synthesized from natural graphite powder by a

importance of diagnosing caries at an early stage has increased . in conventional procedures , \\n the diagnosis of caries has mainly consisted of visual inspection and tactile assessment with probing . \\n however , lussi   reported that the sensitivity of detecting caries was 0.62 by visual inspection and 0.82 by probing . \\n in addition , the pressure of probing can damage the demineralized fissure and increase the risk that caries progress [ 3 , 4 ] . to promote mi , diagnosis without a probe has been recommended . \\n the laser fluorescence - based caries detection device diagnodent ( kavo , germany ) has been introduced as an alternative . however , no single detection method for caries is sufficient ; therefore , the combination of some detection methods has been recommended [ 57 ] . \\n recent improvements in the personal computer have made the process of digital imaging more efficient and convenient . \\n if the shape of caries can be quantified , and the relationship between the numerical value and the condition of the lesion can be demonstrated , this information would be helpful to diagnose dental caries . \\n the authors of this paper have previously shown that the fractal dimension and proportion of the area of pit - and - fissure discoloration to the area of occlusal surface obtained by digital imaging were significantly correlated with the depth of the caries and the diagnodent values in extracted teeth . \\n for assessment of the method as a diagnostic system , the ability of the diagnosis , such as the sensitivity , the specificity , and the accuracy , should be researched in clinical situation . \\n the aim of this study was to assess the possibility of the clinical application of the diagnosis of occlusal caries using digital imaging by examining the sensitivity , the specificity , and the accuracy in comparison with the diagnodent values and the dentists ' diagnoses . \\n one hundred teeth ( 36 premolars and 64 molars ) with pit - and - fissure discoloration from 19 outpatients were examined at the clinic of oral diagnosis and general dentistry , dental hospital , tokyo medical and dental university . \\n the occlusal surface of each tooth was washed with the robinson brush to remove dental plaque without any abrasive paste . \\n then , pit - and - fissure discoloration was dried by air and measured three times using diagnodent . \\n the mean scores were used as the diagnodent values of the teeth ( dd ) . \\n next , the occlusal surface of each tooth was photographed as large as possible with an intraoral digital camera ( penscope , morita , japan ) . \\n each image was stored in a personal computer using a video capture interface ( pc - mdvd / u2 , buffalo , japan ) . without knowing the dd , \\n a dentist preliminarily diagnosed each tooth using visual inspection and tactile examination to decide which treatment plan would be appropriate ( preventive or operative ) . \\n the clinical diagnosis of preventive treatment for teeth was classified as co. on the other hand , carious lesions requiring operative treatment were removed in a conventional clinical way . if the resulting cavity preparation was limited in the enamel , then the clinical diagnosis was classified as c1 . if the resulting cavity preparation reached the dentin , and sound tissue still remained between the cavity and the pulp chamber , then the clinical diagnosis was classified as c2 . \\n five dentists ranging from 3 to 15 years of professional experience examined the teeth after calibration of the criteria of the caries assessment conducted before the study ; the calibration was done as follows ; first , the five dentists examined 30 extracted teeth and decide which treatment plan would be appropriate ( preventive or operative ) . at that time \\n then , the teeth were sliced pallarel to the teeth axis and to the depth of lesion for each tooth was determined . \\n at last , the dentists discussed to accord the treatment planning for each tooth referring the depth of the lesion . \\n the digital photographs obtained were processed and analyzed using image analysis software ( image j , nih , usa ) . \\n first , each image was converted to an 8-bit gray - scale image , in which the density of grayness of each pixel was linearly scaled from min 0 ( black ) to max 255 ( white ) . \\n then , the occlusal surface in the image was isolated from the background using a density histogram of the image , and the area was measured . \\n pit - and - fissure discoloration was also isolated from the occlusal surface using the density histogram , and the area was measured . \\n the proportion of the area of pit - and - fissure discoloration to the area of the occlusal surface was calculated ( pa ) . \\n next , the image of the isolated pit - and - fissure discoloration was converted into a binary image , in which the density of pit - and - fissure discoloration was 0 , and its background was 255 , followed by calculating the fractal dimension of pit - and - fissure discoloration ( fd ) . \\n differences in fd , pa , and dd between each clinical diagnosis were analyzed using two - way anova and games - howell test to reveal the clinical diagnosis and the effect of the examining dentists . \\n the correlation between the clinical diagnosis and each fd , pa , and dd was analyzed using spearman 's correlation coefficient . \\n discriminant formulas were obtained using discriminant analysis with the treatment plan ( preventive / operative ) as the objective variable and fd , pa , and dd as explanatory variables . \\n sensitivity and specificity were calculated by applying fd , pa , and dd to each discriminant formula . \\n the accuracy , ratio of the number of teeth showing accordance between the treatment plan decided by the dentists and the predictive treatment plan decided using the discriminant formula to the number of all the teeth , was also obtained . \\n the entire process was approved by the ethics committee of the faculty of dentistry , tokyo medical and dental university ( no . 317 ) . \\n fd , pa , and dd values corresponding to each clinical diagnosis are shown in table 1 . \\n the two - way anova revealed that the fd , pa , and dd were different among the clinical diagnosis ( p < .01 ) . \\n on the other hand , the difference of the examining dentists did not affect the fd , pa , and dd . \\n spearman 's correlation coefficients between the clinical diagnosis and each fd , pa , and dd were 0.743 , 0.700 , and 0.652 , respectively ( p < .01 ) . \\n there were also significant correlations among fd , pa , and dd ( p < .01 ) . \\n table 2 shows the discriminant formula , sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy of each explanatory variable . \\n based on the discriminant formula of each explanatory variable , the thresholds of fd , pa , and dd between preventive and operative treatments were 1.20 , 0.012 , and 28.8 , respectively . \\n the sensitivity of fd was greater than that of pa , dd , and the combination of fd and pa . \\n the specificity of pa was greater than that of fd , dd , and the combination of fd and pa . \\n the accuracy of the combination of fd and pa was greater than that of fd , pa , and dd . \\n previously , it was reported that the fractal dimension and the proportion of the area of pit - and - fissure discoloration to the area of occlusal surface were significantly correlated with the depth of the caries and the diagnodent values in extracted teeth . in this study , \\n the fractal dimensions for c0 , c1 and c2 in the former study were 0.97 , 1.30 , and 1.52 , respectively . \\n these results indicate that image analysis of molar pit - and - fissure discoloration was clinically useful for the diagnosis of caries . \\n an increase of the proportion of the area of discoloration corresponded to a change of the volume of caries lesion , while an increase of the fractal dimension corresponded to a change of the shape of the lesion caused by caries progression . \\n a fractal is a geometric shape , possessing characteristics of self - similarity or self - affinity , and widely observed in nature [ 10 , 11 ] . \\n recently , fractals have been in the spotlight in the field of medicine , and research has been introduced regarding its use in the field of diagnosis [ 1214 ] . \\n for example , a point is described as the zero dimension ; a straight line is described as the first dimension , and a plane is described as the second dimension . \\n such decimal dimensions can be obtained by expanding the definition of the dimension as the rate at which the perimeter ( or the surface area ) of an object increases , and the measurement scale is reduced . several ways to measure the fractal dimension have been introduced . in this study \\n , the authors used a simple way to determine the fractal dimension called box counting . in this method , \\n a grid of squares is placed over the object , and the number of squares through which any part of the object passes is counted . \\n this process is repeated with different grids having different sizes . the number of squares placed over the object versus the length of the side of the square are then plotted on log - log scale . when a regression line is obtained from the plots , \\n the degree of uneven complexity of a boundary or a coast can be quantified using this approach . in this research , \\n the fractal dimension of discoloration increased from 0.8 to 1.6 as the depth of the caries increased , which corresponded to a change in the shape of the discolored area from a point or a line to an area based on the progression of the caries . \\n generally , the addition of valuables into discriminant formula is one of the ways to improve the accuracy , however , in this study , the accuracy of the combination of fd and pa was similar to that of single fd . \\n therefore , further study to find other valuables is needed to improve the accuracy of this method by combination of valuables . \\n thus , the accuracy of the diagnosis of occlusal caries using digital images of discolored areas was comparable to that of diagnodent ; therefore , its clinical application as a diagnostic tool is possible . \\n because this study was clinical , the final diagnosis of each examined tooth was not confirmed by a histological procedure but by a dentist 's clinical examination . as mentioned above , \\n , the results of two - way anova showed that the effect of the examining dentist on the dd , pa , and fd values was not significant . \\n therefore , we considered that difference of the diagnosis among the dentists would be small .   in the present study , to examine the possibility of digital imaging in the diagnosis of occlusal caries , diagnodent was used as a comparative pre - existing dental caries detection tool . \\n there are other caries detection tools , such as fiber optic transillumination ( foti ) , digital imaging fiber optic transillumination ( difoti ) , quantitative laser or light fluorescence ( qlf ) , and electrical conductive measurements ( ecm ) . \\n foti , difoti , and qlf have been tested in vivo , however , the number of clinical studies has still been small [ 15 , 16 ] . on the other hand , \\n a comparatively long time has passed since diagnodent was introduced to the market , and many findings have been reported . \\n sheehy et al .   reported that diagnodent had greater sensitivity and specificity than ecm . \\n the correlation coefficient between diagnodent readings and the depth and the volume of caries lesions was reported to be 0.47 . \\n several researches have pointed out that diagnodent measurements are affected by other factors , such as hypomineralization , plaque , debris , staining and wetness [ 1921 ] , while a high correlation between inter and intraobserver agreements was also mentioned [ 22 , 23 ] . \\n we employed diagnodent as a comparison because the diagnosis was provided as a number , the handling was easy , and , moreover , its clinical use has been discussed in other studies .   in the present study , \\n diagnosis using digital images of pit - and - fissure discoloration depended on the statistical relationship between the shape of discoloration and the depth of caries . \\n the shape of the discolored area in the occlusal surface is , however , possibly affected by medication history , individual history , and lifestyle . \\n consequently , diagnosis using digital images of pit - and - fissure discoloration is rather experimental . \\n additionally , the procedure can not be applied to colorless lesions , such as acute caries . \\n therefore , diagnosis using digital images of pit - and - fissure discoloration should not be used for definitive diagnosis . \\n rather , initial diagnosis , screening such as mass examination would be suitable because of its good sensitivity of fd and , the convenience of the procedure . actually , the core of the diagnostic system is digital imaging processing by computers . \\n if computer programing for all procedures was achieved , then screening of hundreds of examinees would be automated after photograph taking , which would make mass examination less time - consuming with low cost . for such automated uses of the computer \\n , the process of extracting colors from the image must be improved ; in this study , the threshold for the colored area was decided one by one by an observer 's visual inspection . how to calculate the fractal dimension is also open to discussion . \\n we used the box - counting method attached in the image analysis software , image j. the box - counting method is only suitable for self - similar profiles , not for more general , self - affine cases , that is , the fractal dimension using the box - counting method might be the approximate value . \\n a special computer program must be developed to measure the fractal dimension more accurately , for example , the minkowski method or the richardson method [ 8 , 10 ] . \\n as mentioned above , the shape of the discolored area on an occlusal surface is affected by many factors . \\n therefore , the thresholds or the discriminant formulas acquired from this research are not universal . \\n further research is needed to determine the discriminant formulas to diagnose caries using the image analysis of molar pit - and - fissure discoloration .\", \"craniofacial defects are rare , disfiguring facial anomalies , with an incidence of about 1.4 to 4.9 cases per 100,000 live births . \\n craniofacial clefts may be caused by failure of the maxillary processes to fuse , external pressure , amniotic bands , oligohydramnios , central disorganization of the neural crest , and hematomas . in 1973 , \\n the median cleft of the upper lip , or tessier 0 class , has a variety of presentations , ranging from a minimal notching of the lip

broadly classified into true and false ; false clefts are due to agenesis of the medial nasal process , while true clefts are due to failure of the medial nasal process to fuse . \\n treatment of median clefts depends on the clinical presentation and may vary from simple alignment of orbicularis oris and vermilion , to reconstruction of the cupid 's bow and philtrum for true median clefts , and complex craniofacial procedures in case of false median clefts . \\n various techniques have been described to repair mild or moderate true median cleft lips . here \\n we report using a pfeifer incision to correct a moderate true median cleft of the upper lip . \\n pfeifer incision includes wavy lines , which elongate the incised tissues as the waves are straightened to close in a straight line , and also provide extra tissue for a tension free closure . \\n a five - year - old boy with a facial cleft presented to our clinic . on examination \\n , there was a median cleft of the upper lip involving the white roll , with no bony involvements . \\n the highest- ( points a , a ) , and the deepest - points ( points b , b ) of the white roll were marked on both sides . \\n subsequently

isolation or be a part of a syndrome such as orofacial - digital syndrome . \\n false clefts are associated with abnormalities of the forebrain and are categorized under the category of holoprosencephaly . in 1937 , veau   categorized median clefts to notch of the lip , median cleft extending to the columella , and defects due to atrophy of the midline facial structures . \\n median cleft face syndrome , frontonasal dysplasia , and tessier 0 clefts are various terms used to describe abnormalities associated with true median clefts that are not accompanied by forebrain abnormalities . \\n the tessier 0 anomaly may present as a small notch in the soft tissue , or in association with hypertelorism , midline craniofacial osseous defects , and hairline abnormalities . \\n various treatment options are present for mild deformities which do not involve the white roll . \\n when developing the treatment plan , reconstruction of the cupid 's bow , labial philtrum , vermillion , and buccal mucosa should be kept in mind . \\n urata and kawamoto   described using a v - y flap , while weimer et al ,   used a diamond incision to repair these anomalies . da \\n silva frietas and colleagues   described a mucosal z transposition technique to treat mild cases . for moderate defects involving the philtrum , \\n these waves are subsequently approximated in a straight line , which help expanding the length and width of the tissue . \\n this incision has previously been used to correct other tessier clefts with a high success rate . \\n the above - mentioned studies prove the versatility of the pfeifer incision . in our case \\n we were able to achieve adequate symmetry of the philtrum and the cupid 's bow , which is important in cases like this . \\n the postoperative results were excellent and proper approximation of the orbicularis oris muscle and the vermilion was achieved with a symmetrical cupid 's bow and philtrum . \\n the only disadvantage of this technique is that the final closure line is placed directly over the philtrum . \\n since the presentation of midline cleft deformities varies widely , each case should be individually considered and treated . \\n pfeifer incisions can successfully provide mucosal length , vermilion fullness , and lip symmetry in patients with moderate median cleft lip .\", 'pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important gram - negative opportunistic pathogen that has the capability to create variable clinical infections , including , but not limited to , wound infections , urinary tract infections ( utis ) , and blood stream infections ( bsi ) , particularly in hospitalized and immunocompromised patients ( 1 , 2 ) . \\n pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second most common cause of hospital - acquired pneumonia , as well as the third and fifth common cause of hospital - acquired utis in usa and europe , respectively ( 2 - 4 ) . evidently , p. aeruginosa due to low permeability of its outer membrane in combination with efflux pump overexpression is intrinsically resistant to a variety of antibiotics ( 5 ) . \\n expression of different classes of extended - spectrum -lactamas enzymes along with aminoglycoside - modifying enzymes ( aminoglycoside phosphoryltransferases , aminoglycoside acetyltransferases , and aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferases ) , and mutation are other well - characterized mechanisms for antibiotic resistance in p. aeruginosa ( 6 , 7 ) . \\n data extracted from several independent studies in iran showed that p. aeruginosa was responsible for 11%-32.4% of utis , 17.2%-32.4% of pneumonia , 36.7% of bsi , and 47% of wound infections ( 8 - 12 ) . moreover , based on previous studies performed in iran , treatment of p. aeruginosa infections is a major concern for health - care setting due to its high resistant rate to different antibiotics ( 12 , 13 ) . \\n since determining bacterial isolates relatedness is essential for understanding the transmission routes , different typing methods that can be divided into two major categories , phenotypic and genotypic methods , have been established ( 14 ) . \\n phenotypic methods such as serotyping , pyocin typing , and antimicrobial susceptibility typing depend on the environmental factors , therefore , have low discriminatory power ( 14 , 15 ) . \\n genotypic methods have been performed by different typing techniques such as restriction fragment length polymorphism ( rflp ) , pulsed field gel electrophoresis ( pfge ) , multilocus sequence typing ( mlst ) , enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus - pcr ( eric - pcr ) , variable number tandem repeat ( vntr ) , dna hybridization and random amplified polymorphic dna ( rapd ) ( 16 - 21 ) . \\n although mlst and pfge have more discriminatory power , they are expensive , especially in developing countries ( 22 ) . \\n rapd - pcr has the advantage of being fast , reproducible , simple , and low - cost , thus , it is an appropriate approach for primary screening of epidemic strains in large number of isolates ( 23 , 24 ) . \\n to our knowledge , limited data are available about genetic diversity of p. aeruginosa recovered from different clinical specimens in isfahan ; the purpose of the current study was to determine the antibiotic susceptibility profiles and genetic relatedness in p. aeruginosa isolated from patients admitted to a referral hospital in isfahan , iran . \\n this study was conducted at a teaching referral hospital of isfahan , iran , from february 2013 to november 2013 . during the mentioned period \\n , a total of 150 non - duplicate samples ( urine , sputum , wound , blood , and eye discharge ) taken from hospitalized - patients admitted to different wards of hospital were analyzed . \\n primary identification of p. aeruginosa was done based on the standard conventional biochemical tests , including gram staining , catalase , oxidase , oxidative - fermentative ( of ) tests ,

determination of potential clonal relatedness ( 31 - 33 ) . \\n out of 150 samples , 54 ( 36% ) were positive for p. aeruginosa culture . \\n distribution of the 54 isolates were as follow , urine 39 ( 72.2 % ) , sputum 7 ( 13% ) , wound 5 ( 9.3% ) , blood 2 ( 3.7% ) , and eye discharge 1 ( 1.9% ) . \\n the most frequent involved wards were icu 28 ( 51.9% ) , followed by graft 12 ( 22.2% ) , internal 5 ( 9.3% ) and surgery 9 ( 16.7% ) . \\n thirty - six isolates ( 66.7% ) belonged to male patients and 18 ( 33.3% ) belonged to female patients . \\n the highest percentage ( 55.6% ) of resistance was observed against ceftazidime and imipenem with 30 of the isolates being resistant ; all isolates were sensitive to polymyxin b ( figure 1 ) . \\n twenty - eight ( 51.8% ) isolates tested in the study revealed resistance to all applied antibiotics except for polymyxin b. electrophoresis patterns of rapd - pcr for some isolates of studied p. aeruginosa are shown in figure 2 . \\n genetic relatedness of clinical isolates of the detected p. aeruginosa has been carried out using rapd - pcr assay , which showed 55% to 100% similarity ( figure 3 ) . \\n the number of bands in rapd typing varied from 2 to 12 , with the length of 150 bp to 4300 bp . \\n rapd fingerprinting results of p. aeruginosa based on  80% showed 39 different groups ( figure 3 ) . although the majority of isolates had unique fingerprint , group one composed of 3 isolates ( patients s48 , s29 , s31 ) . \\n isolate s29 was fully sensitive to applied antibiotics , whereas isolates s31 and s48 were resistance to applied antibiotics ( figure 3 ) . \\n groups 22 , 31 , 35 , and 36 , each consisted of two isolates , were also obtained from the same ward ( figure 3 ) . \\n based on 65% similarity level , eight main cluster , with most of the strains belonging to cluster 1 were detected ( figure 3 ) . \\n line 1 , 14 dna ladder ( 3000 - 100 bp ) , lines 2 - 13 showed 12 different rapd types .

antibiotic susceptibility profiles and genetic relatedness among bacterial infectious agents are essential steps for infection control ( 34 ) . to improve our understanding about p. aeruginosa antibiotic resistance and their distribution , 54 non - duplicate isolates of p. aeruginosa by using kirby - bauer s disk diffusion and rapd - pcr methods \\n p. aeruginosa involved in this study were highly resistant to different antibiotic families like , monobactams , cephalosporins , quinolones , and carbapenems ( figure 1 ) . \\n our isolates had the highest resistance rate to imipenem and meropenem ( 55.6% ) , which is higher than similar reports from iran ( 11 - 13 ) . \\n in addition , increased percentage of resistance to ciprofloxacin and amikacin ( 53.7% and 48.1% , respectively ) were observed in comparison with previous study ( 29% and 17% ) that have been performed in the same hospital ( 35 ) . \\n although , in our investigated hospital , carbapenems ( imipenem , meropenem ) along with amikacin are the most currently used antibiotics for the treatment of p. aeruginosa infections , results of this study revealed that prescription of them should be limited . in order to optimize treatment of p. aeruginosa infections in our hospital ( \\n also it can be mentioned as a limitation of this study ) , determination of resistance to other antibiotics like piperacillin , piperacillin - clavulanic acid , ticarcillin , ticarcillin - clavulanic acid , gentamicin , and cefepime , are essential to be evaluated in future studies . \\n the finding of present study corresponds with the data presented by haeili and associates , which showed the lowest percentage of resistance ( 0% ) to polymyxin b ( 11 ) . \\n there are reports that pfge and mlst are more reliable methods for establishing clonal relatedness among p. aeruginosa strains , but because of the high cost , their utilization is limited , especially in developing countries ( 36 , 37 ) . allegedly , rapd typing is a valuable and useful method for the evaluation of genetic diversity among p. aeruginosa isolates ( 21 , 23 , 24 ) . out of various primers applied for rapd - pcr , \\n primer 272 was reliable because of its higher discriminatory power and reproducible profiles ( 38 , 39 ) . in the present study , all 54 isolates were typeable by rapd - pcr ; moreover , rapd typing allowed us to reveal 54 unique finger prints among 54 clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa . \\n previous studies performed in iran showed different distribution of genotypes . for instance , in the study of salimi et al . \\n , by using rapd typing , only 8 different groups among 129 isolates of p. aeruginosa were reported ( 40 ) . in addition , in another study conducted by nanvazadeh et al . \\n 9 groups among 50 clinical samples of p. aeruginosa were observed ( 41 ) . using limited source for recovering p. aeruginosa \\n although in a previous study the correlation between rapd type and p. aeruginosa infection was suggested , our finding is not in agreement with these data ( 42 ) . \\n furthermore , our data demonstrated a weak correlation between rapd and antibiotic resistance profiles ; it is supported by the results of other studies ( 34 , 43 ) . in a number of cases , \\n the reason for this diversity may be attributed to the involved different antibiotic resistance mechanisms ( 5 - 7 ) . \\n moreover ; results of the independent studies showed that determination of antibiotic resistance pattern as phenotypic method for p. aeruginosa typing has low discriminatory power ( 34 , 43 ) . according to our data , \\n the majority of isolates probably originated from host itself , but cross infection of p. aeruginosa is possible to occur in studied hospital . \\n for instance , isolates s48 , s29 , and s31 were recovered from urine of the patients in different wards or isolates 26 and 33 from the same ward and sample had genetic similarity ( based on rapd fingerprinting results ) . before taking any decision \\n , we think that clonal relatedness of obtained isolates should be confirmed by more discriminatory methods , such as pfge or mlst . in conclusion , \\n prescription of common antibiotics ( imipenem and amikacin ) in our hospital due to high resistance rate must be restricted . according to our data , considerable genetic diversity exists among isolated p. aeruginosa \\n ; it is possible that different sources of p. aeruginosa be involved in our hospital that can lead to host colonization . in order to accurately control the infection , other p. aeruginosa isolated from hospital environment', 'cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and accounted for 7.6 million cases ( 13% of all deaths ) in 2008 ; in 2013 in the united states there are 12,340 estimated new cases and 4,030 deaths by cervical cancer [ american cancer society : cancer facts and figures 2013 ] . \\n meanwhile in romania , based on statistical data from 2012 , cervical cancer is ranked third place taking in account the women cancer incidence , after the breast and colorectal cancer . \\n cervical cancer develops in a multi - stage process , successively passing from a cervix with a normal epithelium to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and finally leading to invasive cervical cancer . a relevant epidemiologic risk circumstance for the progress of the cervical cancer is represented by the presence of high risk human papillomavirus infections . \\n consequently , considerable importance has been given to the molecular premise which leads to the progression of cervical cancer . \\n rnai ( rna interference ) is a natural mechanism able to specific inhibit a target gene . \\n the prospective exploitation as a therapeutic has lately been strengthened by the small interfering rna ( sirna ) delivery to human tumours . \\n rnai has been demonstrated as a relevant investigation device for particular target genes by using exogenous sirnas . \\n sirnas are single - stranded non - coding rnas with 2023 nucleotides length , being able to negatively modulate gene expression profile at post - transcriptional level . \\n sirnas represent an encouraging novel type of medicaments for cancer therapy , as a result of targeting the mutated tumour suppressor genes or activated oncogenes . \\n many recent investigations have shown that sirna can efficiently inhibit oncogene expression in cancer cells . \\n various investigations demonstrated clearly that the deactivation of p53 constitutes a crucial step in carcinogenesis . \\n the present study was designed to investigate the potential use of p53 rnai to block p53 expression , as well as the subsequent effect on cell invasion and gene expression

cervical cancer is considered as a preventable disorder there is a significant risk of disease recurrence causing a persuasive necessity to research new therapeutic targets for this disease management . \\n it is now well recognized that the tumour progression of all cancers is characterized by intensified proliferation and invasion rate and diminished in apoptosis . at the same time \\n the apoptosis and angiogenesis are interconnected as can be observed from figure 4 , using string.9 database . \\n the idea of this study is in agreement with the previous studies which are based on the hypothesis that once mutated , p53 exercised oncogenic role . by using sirna \\n the role of the present study is to emphasize the cooperation between oncogenic mechanisms , confirming the crosstalk between apoptotic and angiogenic mechanisms . \\n this has a significant therapeutic relevance based on the fact that mutated p53 is related to cancer aggressiveness   or to promoting metastasis . in a similar study \\n was observed that , by using sirna targeting p53/p73 , tumoral cells were sensitized to chemotherapy . in a recent study , pinx1 was displayed as a novel target gene of p53 , proposing the suppression of p53/pinx1 pathway as a novel mechanism to enhance the telomerase activity in cervical cancer cells , and leading to reduction of cell proliferation . \\n targeting oncogenic signals such as the mutated p53 gene that gains oncogenic role , we observed a downregulation of specific genes involved in apoptosis but also in angiogenesis , connected with a reduction of the invasion rate in the case of p53sirna therapy . \\n after 24 hours of treatment with p53sirna we can observe downregulations of important genes involved in apoptosis and angiogenesis , as displayed in figure 2 . \\n this study confirmed our hypothesis that p53 plays a central role in carcinogenesis as displayed in figure 3 , as important therapeutic target . \\n p53 could promote the convergence of the apoptotic and angiogenic pathways in cervical cancer cells . \\n it has been proved that p53 is able to indirectly downregulate vegf gene expression , via the retinoblastoma ( rb ) , in a p21-dependent mode , confirming its function in cell - cycle regulation as displayed by recent studies . \\n the complete comprehension of the cross - talk between p53 and angiogenic pathways represents a challenge in cancer therapy [ 2426 ] . \\n another study reveals that mutant p53 correlates with overexpression of vegf . in a similar study \\n the inhibition of mutant p53 represents a significant therapeutic target , a fact emphasized by walerych as  rebel angel . \\n p53 gene knockdown in hela cells plays an important role not only in apoptosis but also in angiogenesis through various mechanisms that regulate tumour cell development and migration . \\n the angiogenic phenotype related to p53 targeted by sirna in human cancers is frequently associated with resistance to conventional genotoxic anticancer agents . \\n therefore , p53 inhibitions become dependent and rely on angiogenesis for growth and metastasis . the results in the current research \\n may also have an important significance outside the context of cervical cancer , by using specific inhibitors for p53 for increasing therapeutic response in a wide range of tumoral pathology .', \"atherosclerosis is a coronary heart disease ( chd ) , and is the most common cause of death in the industrialized world . \\n high blood pressure ( bp ) , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus ( dm ) and smoking are considered as the major risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis . \\n in addition , increasing age , male sex , family history and genetic factors predispose patients to chd.1 there is some data that have suggested the possible potential role of some infectious agents in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.26 the possibility of infectious agents may trigger the process of atherosclerosis by direct or indirect inflammatory effects , especially at younger ages.5 although different studies have been carried out to prove this hypothesis some infections may contribute in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis ; nothing has ever been conclusively proven . the possible role of some agents such as chlamydophila pneumoniae,6 \\n hepatitis c. virus,7 \\n human

plaques that were defined as study group , and 30 coronary artery tissues without atherosclerotic plaques that served as the control group . \\n archived slides of the two groups were reviewed by two pathologists for confirmation of diagnosis , tissue adequacy and selection of the best paraffin blocks for dna extraction . \\n for all subjects , the weight and height were determined , and the body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated . \\n five to seven , 5-m - thick sectionswere cut from each ffpe specimen under sterile conditions , and then the dna was extracted by using proteinase k and non - heating dna extraction method.20 dna concentration was determined by using the thermo scientific nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer , and specimens with low dna content ( < 20 ng/l ) were excluded from the study . \\n pcr was performed for detecting c. pneumoniae dna by using the pcr kits ( dna technology ( jsc ) , pcr kit , moscow , russia ) . \\n 10 l of pcr master mix and 0.5 l unit of taqpolymerase ( hot start taq dna polymerase ) were added into each paraffin sealed tube and were mixed , then 5 l ( 100 ng ) of dna samples were added ( except for positive and negative controls ) and were spun at 1,000 rpm for 3 - 5 s. the tubes were placed into applied biosystems ( abi ) veriti thermal cycler and pcr was performed with the program of 180 s at 94c for the first step and then 45 cycles was run as follows : 50 s at 94c , 50 s at 64c , 50 s at 72c . \\n amplified pcr products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel , stained with ethidium bromide , and photographed under ultraviolet light by gel documentation instrument . \\n pcr was interpreted as positive when the dna band corresponds to the band of the positive control ( 254bp ) in addition to the internal control band ( ic:370 bp ) . \\n results of pcr in control and atherosclerotic groups were analyzed with spss version 11.5 by a statistician . \\n we used fisher 's exact test for comparison of categorical variables and independent sample t - test for continuous variable in patients and control groups . \\n the age range in the control group was 20 - 46 years with a mean ( standard deviation ) age of 26.0 ( 6.41 ) years . in the study group , \\n it ranges from 18 to 50 years with a mean ( sd ) age of 32.0 ( 9.46 ) years and the t - test showed no significant difference between the ages of patients in the study and control groups ( p=0.97 ) . \\n twenty - five patients ( 83.3% ) were males and five patients ( 16.7% ) were females . \\n the male to female ratio was 5:1 and no significant difference was seen between study and control groups for gender ( p = 1.00 ) by fisher 's exact test . \\n the mean bmi of the patients in the study and control groups were 24.4 ( 3.77 ) and 23.9 ( 2.62 ) kg / m respectively [ table 1 ] . the frequency of atherosclerotic plaques in the different vessels of heart of the patients in the study is as shown in table 2 . as a result , the possibility of the appearance of advanced atherosclerotic plaques s in lca was higher than the two other vessels . \\n concurrent occurrences of different stages of atherosclerosis were seen in our patients . only one vessel involvement with fibro - fatty morphology ( mild ) \\n was seen in five patients ( 16.7% ) , one vessel with advanced plaque was observed in three patients ( 10.0% ) , seven patients ( 23.3% ) had one vessel with fibro - fatty and one vessel with advanced plaque , two vessels with advanced plaque were noticed in six patients ( 20.0% ) , three vessels with advanced plaque were observed in five patients ( 16.7% ) and four patients ( 13.3% ) had two vessels with advanced plaque and one fibro - fatty morphology . \\n comparisons between patients with coronary atherosclerosis and controls for weight , height and body mass index the frequency of atherosclerotic plaques in different vessels of the heart in the study group positive pcr result for c. pneumonia was seen in one ( 3.3% ) sample among the 30 coronary artery tissues with atherosclerosis ( advanced plaque ) , while all the control samples were negative . \\n fisher 's exact test showed no significant difference for detection of c. pneumoniae between samples of coronary artery with and without atherosclerotic plaque ( p = 1 ) . \\n ischemic heart disease could be observed in the absence of its major risk factors such as increasing age , male gender , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , smoking and dm . \\n inflammatory cells are seen during all steps of atherogenesis , and some infectious agents may trigger this inflammation.113 although some studies showed that c. pneumoniae can increase the risk of atherosclerosis , 61819 but we did not find any significant difference in the frequency of c. pneumoniae dna isolation in the coronary arteries with and without atherosclerosis by pcr method . \\n we believe that at least two important factors can account for this discrepancy in the results from previous studies : methodology and epidemiology . \\n c pneumonia infection can be diagnosed by various methods such as serology with an increase in serum antibodies against the organism , dna detectionby pcr , immunocytochemistry , electron microscopyand c. pneumonia isolation by culture.14 in other studies , the most widely used method for identifying of c. pneumoniae infection was based on antibody detection . \\n the frequency of antibody against c. pneumoniae starts to rise in children and is observed approximately in 50% of adolescents.1214 somesero - epidemiologic studies have shown a relationship between c. pneumoniae and atherosclerosis . \\n saikku et al.,21 podsiady et al.22 and romano et al.23 detected a higher level of antibody against c. pneumoniae in chd compared to control group but zibaeenezhad et al.,17 romeo et al.,24 and ericson et al.,25 found that the presence of antibodies was unable to predict coronary artery events . \\n we used pcr for detection of c. pneumonia ; this assay appears to be more sensitive than cell culture.1426 our finding was in concordance with those of west et al.,15 jantos et al.27 and satpathy et al.28 similarly , reszka et al.,29 studied presence of c. pneumonia dna in aortic vessels , voorend et al.30 in cerebral vessels , and kwon et al.31 in carotid arteries and could not establish any significant difference in pcr results between the study and control groups . \\n these findings suggest that serology could detect past as well as present infection , whereas pcr detects current c. pnuemoniae infection . considering the study of west et al.15 and satpathy et al.28 who showed a higher c. pnuemoniae igg antibody in patients with chd compared to control group but could not detect the organism by nested pcr assay in any specimen strengthens our hypothesis . \\n we believe that the lack of standardized methods for the detection of c. pnuemoniae infection used in the aforementioned studies is probably one of the important reasons for the discrepancies in their results . c. pnuemoniae is a common human pathogen ; the majority of infected subjects have few or no symptoms . \\n the frequency of antibodies to c. pneumoniae is approximately 50% in the northern hemisphere.1432 exposure to c. pneumoniae is probably common in iran . \\n moghaddam et al.33 reported 38% seropositivity for c. pneumonia antibodies ( igg and igm ) in healthy subjects by elisa method in tehran , iran . \\n studies carried out in iran on the association between c. pneumonia infection , and atherosclerosis revealed conflicting results ; while some studies showed the association between c. pneumonia infection , and atherosclerosis1834 others didnt demonstrate any significant associationbetween c. pneumonia and atherosclerosis.1735 the anatomical localization of vessels may also be a factor influencing the results from previous studies . \\n jha et al.6 showed that c. pneumoniae may be associated with chd and coronary artery was more susceptible to c. pneumoniae as compared with carotid artery . \\n bahrmand et al.25 and ericson et al.34 examined the relationship of c. pneumoniae infection to the severity of coronary atherosclerosis by pcr and serology respectively . \\n they examined coronary artery samples with two different methods , and both revealed a high rate of reactivity to this bacterium in severe atherosclerosis and a much lower rate in mild atherosclerosis ; therefore , they concluded that severity ( stage ) of atherosclerosis can be presumed as an important factor in diagnosis of c. pneumoniae infection . \\n our study was performed on 30 archived ffpe coronary artery tissues of patients with atherosclerosis . \\n this sample size may be too small for final decision ; therefore , future study with a larger number of case groups and also using fresh specimens are helpful . in conclusion , we did not find any significant association between c. pneumoniae infection and coronary artery atherosclerosis by pcr method . \\n further studies involving a greater number of patients and also using more specific methods for detecting living c. pneumonia organisms by culture can be helpful .\", 'confrontation with the consequences of diabetes causes a crisis in physical , mental , and spiritual dimensions . sometimes the spiritual crisis can be tremendous . since spiritual health coordinates different aspects of human life , this study aimed to identify the spiritual health of patients with defects caused by diabetes \\n this was a qualitative - phenomenological and descriptive study and the participants were selected from rehabilitation centers in isfahan and valiasr hospital in zanjan . \\n outcome of this phase of the study was 173 codes and 2 groups that included hindering factors in spiritual health and the promotion of the relation with god . \\n the concepts that patients had experienced as hindering factors of the treatment process were disappointment and hopelessness , guilt , feeling distant from god , quitting obligatory acts and knowing god as cruel . \\n the concepts that patients had experienced as contributing factors to the healing process were resorting to imams , god s ordering the disease as a reward , fear of god s punishment , believing in miracles , being closer to god , believing in the mercy of god , returning to religious practice , feeling of enjoying life and knowing that the disease is the atonement of sins . \\n with regard to the importance of spiritual and religious care as one of the tasks of nurses , as the key members of health team , they should respect the patients beliefs and values in addition to considering their physical and mental conditions . \\n although the mortality rate in diabetic patients due to ketoacidosis and infection is declining , deaths from diabetes complications including diabetic foot complications has increased dramatically . according to some reports , its rate in the first year after amputation is 1340 percent , in the third year \\n , 3565 percent and in the fifth year it is 3980 percent , which figures are comparable to death rates in malignancies . in addition , the loss of job and the need for medical and nursing care , reduction in social and family interactions , and lifestyle changes are the major problems that influence the family and socioeconomic status of these patients . \\n the absence of the feet and lower limbs can be extremely problematic for these patients and exerts too much energy for walking ; therefore , amputation of higher limbs or development of ulcers may occur . \\n ultimately , these patients with amputated legs need long - term hospitalization , rehabilitation , home care and social support . \\n organ amputation due to diabetes causes crisis in the physical , mental , and spiritual life of the patients . in this case \\n , the spiritual health is the unique element that can harmonize physical , mental and social aspects of the human life and is necessary for coping with the disease . as a matter of fact , \\n when the spiritual health is seriously at risk , a person may experience emotional disturbances such as loneliness , depression and loss of meaning in life . \\n the spirit of prayer is a deep human instinct , which is the center of humanity , and where the passion and knowledge to communicate with the world comes from . \\n forms and statements of people who pray are different : speaking , listening , waiting and wailing . \\n it exposes them to severe stress and they seek different approaches to cope and adapt to life . \\n koenig believes that religion creates a positive attitude towards the world and makes the person powerful against unfortunate events in life such as diseases and helps to improve the life with motivation and energy . \\n this increases tolerance and acceptance of situations that can not be changed . in many cases of emergency \\n in which science is unable to help a person , this issue is of vital importance especially in serious cases . \\n the increasing interest of medical scientists to the impact of praying in the treatment of other diseases can be indicative of treatment of some diseases in case of modern medicine failure . on the other hand , medical researchers also acknowledge the importance of medical procedures of traditional and complementary therapies including prayer to treat the diseases . \\n even the western scientific community has recently published articles showing that doctors can not be indifferent to the religious beliefs of patients for treatment . \\n this study was conducted to understand the spiritual experiences of the patients with organ amputation due to diabetes . \\n the aim of phenomenological studies is to understand the phenomena of human experience through the analysis of participants verbal explanations of experiences . \\n the study population consisted of patients with defects , caused by diabetes , who had referred to rehabilitation centers in esfahan and zanjan provinces . \\n sampling was purposive and the inclusion criteria for participants were the injury caused by diabetes and the willingness to participate in the interview . \\n there were 15 participants entered the study ( 8 men and 7 women at 5070 years of age ) . \\n all interviews were fully recorded and all participants were given a code based on the interviews . \\n in this study , the researcher tried to be cautious with the information collected to be free from any kind of bias and to avoid persons with poor memory and those who could not provide the correct information . in the interviews , the researcher attempted to withdraw his assumptions about the phenomenon under study and thus help to strengthen the data . \\n they were asked that  how has your life changed compared to before the disease ?  in response , they described their life experiences with this disability , and how their performance was changed due to the disease . during the interview , the patients focused on cases where the disease led to their functioning . \\n when it was necessary to clarify the data in specific areas , the questions were asked in details . finally , participants were asked if they wanted to provide alternative explanations in relationship with their disease . \\n the researcher wrote down the participants statements through repeated listening to in - depth interviews . \\n after the formation of concepts and ideas from each interview , the next interview was conducted . \\n the above process was repeated for each interview ( second stage of colaizzi s method ) . \\n after the all interviews , the concepts were formulated in particular subjects and were classified into categories ( third stage ) and eventually all ideas were combined so that a complete description of the phenomenon under the study was derived and presented ( the fourth , fifth and sixth stages ) . \\n finally , the concepts were returned to the participants and were analyzed ( the seventh ) . in this study , \\n the criteria for validity and reliability of data were lincoln and guba . in order to make the study believable , \\n the participants and the research partners also reviewed all the data . to achieve reliability and objectivity of the research data , the account access was used . to increase the portability of the present study , the complete research project was introduced . \\n there were 15 patients participating in this study , comprised of 7 women and 8 men . \\n the age range of participants was between 50 - 75 years with mean age of 59.7 years . \\n length of diabetes was between 530 years and the length of organ amputation caused by diabetes also varied from 2 weeks to 11 years with mean of 4.2 years . the education level comprised of uneducated to junior high school . \\n regarding employment , 53.3 percent of the participants ( 8 people ) lost their jobs and were unemployed due to organ amputation caused by diabetes . \\n about 66.6 percent ( 10 people ) , a leg was amputated below the knee and 26.6 percent of the participants ( 4 people ) both legs were amputated below the knee area . in one patient both legs below the knee and the middle finger were amputated due to diabetes . \\n the concepts derived from patients experiences as factors interfering spiritual health in the treatment process were disappointment and hopelessness , guilt , feeling distant from god , quitting obligatory acts and considering god cruel . \\n factors promoting the healing process were deemed by god , fear of god punishment , belief in miracles , being closer to god , believing god to be merciful , returning to religious practice , enjoying life and indicating the disease as the atonement of sins . \\n most of the participants , encounteringdiabetes - related organ amputatio , said that in such circumstances , intellectual protections , religious sources , and having a strong relationship with a higher power could improve the quality of life , and support the individuals and reduce the severity of symptoms . \\n one of the participants expressed his experiences in turning to practice religion as follows : \\n i was deemed to cut my foot to know god , i am sure there is a wisdom behind this , i ve been weak in a prayer . \\n i was wavering , but when my leg was cut , i celt much closer to god , i know god took my foot , but after this incident , i feel that god wanted to try me , before this , if my prayer was late , i did not become upset . \\n but now , if i do not perform my prayer on time , i will get upset , i feel that i did not do an important job , i become worried with no reason   ( participant 1 ) . \\n another participant stated  when my uncle came to visit me , he said the disease is the expiation of sins . \\n whenever this is said , my heart becomes calm , but i did not commit a sin to deserve such a punishment . even , i had not bothered anything in my life . \\n i do not remember , i wish , everything could be finished in this world   ( participant 3 ) . \\n since my foot ( right foot ) has been cut off , i rub it every day . as i can not bend \\n i m afraid ; it may give testimony against me in the doomsday and tells god that i had been overeating because our hands and legs have rights and we must consider this   ( participant 5 ) .  our tenant is a believer who always reads the quran . \\n when she saw that i was confused , she said , let me read the koran for you to be calm . \\n although i am illiterate and i do not understand anything from the quran , when i hear the peaceful verses of the quran , i forget my sorrows \\n i participate in the middle of moharram mourning ceremony every year and in mourning ceremonies every thursday , but when my leg was cut , i did not go there anymore because i feel i m too far from god and as a result , these ceremonies can not help \\n when the wounds of the foot were fine after surgery , at fast ; i performed my prayer in sitting position , but i realized that i do not feel good in just sitting and praying , i just hurt myself   ( participant 15 ) . \\n the prayer and vow are likely to enhance the human s tolerance against diseases and problems communication with the source of existence and asking him to help would repair the physical and mental powersof man and relieves a lot of disorders and diseases . \\n therefore , the appeal to the imams in patients with organ amputation due to diabetes is high . \\n several studies have also shown that when the spiritual health is at a serious risk , prayers in acute cases may face difficulty . in these cases , praying for the patient can be an important spiritual intervention . \\n one of the most useful sentences in the form of prayers could be the short ones , asking god for fulfillment of the needs , melting away the fears and giving hopes to the patient and ultimately remembering that god is able to meet the needs of the patients . \\n if the patient is depressed , angry or upset or suffering from extreme pain , the expression of praying sentences is like the salt to the wound . \\n nurses should pay close attention in the implementation of these provisions , and if the patients are upset , they should leave them alone . in this regard , a research by tracy et al . \\n was conducted on two thousand nurses in critical care units in which 55% of nurses reported that patients and families were asking them to pray . \\n another study which studied the effects of prayer on blood infection , randomly employed 1691 experimental and 1702 control patients . \\n parameters studied included duration of fever in patients , duration of hospitalization and mortality in the hospital . \\n the results of this study showed a significant difference between the duration of fever and length of patients stay that was lower in the intervention group compared to the control group . \\n nowadays , some of the organizations that evaluate health care systems and are responsible for granting accreditation to them , suggest that the spiritual needs of the patients in health care should be also evaluated . \\n finally , the importance of spiritual and religious care , which is today considered as one of nurses tasks , urges them as the key members of health teams to respect patients beliefs and values as well as their physical and mental aspects .', \"a 21-year - old man ( height = 180 cm , weight = 95 kg , body mass index = 29.3 kg / m ) presented to the outpatient department with a long history of frequent and severe snoring . on physical exam , \\n after a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea was made , a bilateral tonsillectomy and uvulopalatopharyngoplasty was planned for treatment . \\n prior to surgery , the patient had normal laboratory results with hemoglobin ( hb ) of 15.8 g / dl and no systemic or hematological diseases or history of bleeding disorders . on the day of the surgery , the patient received no premedication due to the history of sleep apnea . \\n intraoperative monitors included electrocardiogram , non - invasive blood pressure ( bp ) , pulse oximetry ( spo2 ) , and end - tidal co2 . \\n pre - anesthetic vital signs were bp 120/82 mmhg , hr 68 bpm , and spo2 96% . \\n general anesthesia was induced with remifentanil 0.5 g / kg / min and propofol 180 mg iv at 10:10 am . at loss of eyelash reflex , \\n cisatracurium 16 mg was administered , and the trachea was intubated after a short period of facemask ventilation . \\n anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 2 vol% in 50% oxygen - enriched air and remifentanil 0.2 g / kg / min . \\n the neuromuscular block was antagonized with glycopyrrolate 0.6 mg and pyridostigmine 15 mg iv without neuromuscular monitoring upon the completion of the surgical procedure at 11:25 am . \\n postoperatively , a physical examination confirmed the presence of acute bleeding in the left inferior pole of the tonsillectomy site in the post anesthetic care unit . \\n the surgeon requested an emergent re - operation under general anesthesia for the control of bleeding . \\n a rsi for a second round of general anesthesia was performed with propofol 120 mg , midazolam 5 mg , and rocuronium 100 mg at 11:55 am . \\n the surgeon confirmed active bleeding due to an aberrant arterial blood supply in the left inferior pole of the tonsillectomy site . \\n after the completion of the surgical procedure , no twitch was shown after train - of - four ( tof ) stimulation ( tof = 0 ) with neuro - stim ( model ns-3cc , houston , tx , usa ) at 12:40 pm . the neuromuscular block was then antagonized with sugammadex 200 mg iv and the rocuronium - induced nmb was completely reversed within 2 min . \\n the patient was transferred to the recovery room , and there were no specific findings on physical exam . \\n a post - operative laboratory assessment showed hb of 14.6 g / dl ( table 1 ) . \\n after 6 h and 20 min , the surgeon again requested emergent anesthesia and re - operation for control of bleeding . \\n the surgeon attempted to control bleeding at the ambulatory otolaryngology clinic but was unable to do so . \\n when the patient arrived at the operating room ( or ) , vital signs were within normal limits and hb was found to be 13.2 g / dl . \\n a third round of general anesthesia was induced with propofol 120 mg and rocuronium 40 mg by the on - call resident at 19:00 pm . \\n the neuromuscular block was antagonized with sugammadex 200 mg iv and a tof = 0 at 20:00 pm . \\n the patient was again extubated successfully and transferred to the recovery room with no specific findings ( table 1 ) . after 2 h and 35 min , \\n when the patient arrived at the or , vital signs were stable and hb was 11.6 g / dl . \\n a fourth induction of general anesthesia was performed with propofol 120 mg and rocuronium 40 mg by the same resident at 22:35 pm . during tof stimulation \\n , 1 twitch was seen , and an additional dose of rocuronium 10 mg was given due to bucking 20 min after the induction of anesthesia . at the end of the procedure , \\n the neuromuscular block was antagonized with glycopyrrolate 0.4 mg and pyridostigmine 10 mg iv with a tof = 1 at the end of the surgical procedure at 0:20 am . \\n extubation was carried out after confirming the recovery of consciousness , regular respiration , and the absence of fade on tof monitoring . \\n after extubation , the patient vomited a large amount of blood on the operating table ( approximated to be more than 200 ml ) . \\n however , the patient was alert and aware of his surroundings and had regular respirations ( table 1 ) . \\n after 20 min , the surgeon requested a re - induction of general anesthesia for additional bleeding control . \\n an rsi for a fifth round of general anesthesia was performed with propofol 120 mg and rocuronium 100 mg at 0:40 am . \\n the neuromuscular block was antagonized with glycopyrrolate 0.4 mg and pyridostigmine 10 mg iv with a tof = 1 after the surgical procedure was completed at 1:30 am . \\n approximately 15 min passed after the nmb was antagonized as above , but no evidence of recovery from the rocuronium - induced nmb was seen . \\n therefore , we injected a bolus of iv sugammadex 200 mg to reverse the residual nmb . \\n once again , the nmb was completely reversed within 2 min , and tracheal extubation was performed in the or uneventfully ( table 1 ) . \\n a decision by surgeon was made to perform angiography of the left external carotid artery with subsequent embolization of the bleeding vessel . \\n embolization of the left ascending pharyngeal artery was performed with polyvinyl alcohol particle ( 350 m ) and tornado embolization microcoil ( cook , bloomington , usa ) ( 3/2 mm ) ( fig . \\n the patient 's postoperative course was uneventful , and hb was found to be 10.5 g / dl . \\n pth occurs in approximately 1 in 20 adults ( 5.1% ) , and more than half of patients who bleed are likely to require a procedure of some type to control their hemorrhage . \\n aberrant arterial blood supply to the tonsillar region derived from the internal carotid artery or the carotid bulb may be present . \\n to control bleeding , electrocauterization , packing of the pharynx , or angiographic embolization of the feeding artery may become necessary . \\n the endovascular embolization due to refractory bleeding after tonsillectomy proved to be a valuable treatment method as an effective alternative to surgical intervention . \\n it is a safe and permanent treatment option in this potentially life - threatening complication . in a case such as this , \\n the aberrant arterial blood supply in the left inferior pole of tonsillectomy site caused continuous bleeding . \\n the anesthesiologist has experienced difficulties , because an experienced surgeon has embarrassed due to repetitive bleeding . in the first induction of anesthesia \\n , no problems were encountered with conventional anesthesia , although neuromuscular monitoring was not performed . \\n the most common anesthetic used for rsi during the management of children with pth is succinylcholine . since the introduction of sugammadex , rsi with rocuronium followed by reversal with sugammadex allowed for earlier establishment of spontaneous ventilation than with succinylcholine , which has many adverse side events . during the second round of anesthesia , rocuronium 100 mg ( 1 mg / kg ) \\n was injected for rsi , followed by reversal with sugammadex 200 mg ( 2 mg / kg ) at deep nmb ( tof = 0 ) . during the operation , \\n nmb monitoring was difficult due to problems attaching leads to the arms during the operation . \\n tof stimulation was applied at the ulnar nerve using conventional instrumental monitoring rather than quantitative monitoring due to convenience . \\n deep nmb was maintained for bleeding control in an attempt to not disturb the procedure . during nmb reversal \\n , we found an absence of fade on tof monitoring just 2 min after sugammadex was administered . \\n re - administration of 0.6 mg / kg rocuronium could then be given after sugammadex at the recommended waiting time of 6 h . during the third anesthesia induction , \\n an on - call resident used rocuronium 40 mg for muscle relaxation during intubation followed by reversal with sugammadex 200 mg at deep nmb ( tof = 0 ) . \\n an absence of fade on tof monitoring was shown 2 min after sugammadex was given . for the fourth round of anesthesia , the same resident used rocuronium 40 mg for intubation 2 h and 35 min after the previous nmb reversal with sugammadex . \\n however , we believe this decision was made without considering the recent sugammadex use . when rocuronium is used within a short time interval ( less than 6 h ) after sugammadex administration , the onset time of rocuronium may be prolonged and may also have an unpredictable duration of action . \\n we suspect that the additional dose of rocuronium 10 mg due to bucking may be related to the short time interval between sugammadex and rocuronium administration . in situations such as these , \\n the benzylisoquinoline class of medications are recommended instead of re - administering rocuronium within 6 h after sugammadex . \\n when considering this case , cisatracurium for muscle relaxation and intubation may have been a better choice for the fourth round anesthesia . however , one drawback of cisatracurium is the slower onset time than rocuronium . \\n reversal of the rocuronium - induced nmb with pyridostigmine at a moderate nmb ( tof = 1 ) was uneventful . \\n after extubation , the patient vomited more than 200 ml of blood on the operating table ; however , he was alert and showed regular respirations . \\n postoperative nausea and vomiting ( ponv ) after an operation for pth is common due to blood swallowed during the procedure . \\n therefore , patient awareness and complete reflexes are important , but aspiration must be avoided and monitored closely during the recovery period . however , ponv increases the risk of primary hemorrhage and unexpected postoperative hospital admissions . in this case \\n the patient did not aspirate , but did have an increased risk of pth due to ponv . \\n for the fifth round of anesthesia , rocuronium 100 mg ( 1 mg / kg ) was injected for rsi after a time interval from sugammadex administration of 4 h and 40 min . \\n it has been reported that re - administration of 1.2 mg / kg rocuronium could have been given after sugammadex 2 mg / kg without a waiting time . \\n however , neuromuscular monitoring did not show the expected recovery , and the patient had residual paralysis after 15 min . \\n it has been shown previously that the reversal of nmb with anticholinesterase drugs may not be complete after a large dose of a neuromuscular blocking agent . \\n sugammadex resolved the residual nmb within 2 min , even after reversal with anticholinesterase agents , and is a safe alternative to reversal of nmb induced by steroidal non - depolarizing agents . in this case , deep rocuronium - induced nmb can be reversed successfully with sugammadex at doses of 2 mg / kg and in as little as 2 min . \\n re - administration of rocuronium within a short time interval after sugammadex may result in unpredictable effects of the nmb agent . \\n sugammadex made it possible to perform a rapid , complete reverse when the residual block was maintained by an incomplete reversal of anticholinesterase .\", 'infertility has been recognized as a public health issue worldwide ( 1 ) leading to an increasing need to the use of assisted reproductive technologies ( art ) , including in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) . \\n after the first reported case of ivf in 1978(2 ) art enabled millions of people to have their own children in cases when pregnancy did not occur under natural circumstances . \\n 700,000 cycles a year in the usa and europe together ( 3,4 ) . despite of evolving intracytoplasmatic sperm injection ( icsi ) technique \\n a success rate of 25% and 28% has been reported in 2005(7 ) and 2008(8 ) , respectively . \\n nowadays , this rate went up to 32% ( 9 ) , which can not be considered as a significant development . \\n earlier clinical protocols preferred multiple embryo transfer , but multiple gestations can result in the increased risk of preterm delivery ( 10 - 16 ) . \\n other studies report that multiple gestations also increased the risk of low birth weight cerebral palsy ( 17 ) . in the us alone , preterm births resulting from multiple pregnancies during ivf cause a 1 billion usd extra cost to the social insurance ( 18 ) . in order to exclude the discussed risk factors , \\n it is imperative , however , that accurate and economical methods should be developed to ensure that the most viable euploid embryo is selected for transfer . \\n ideally , such tests would be noninvasive , lessening the risks to the embryo and reducing costs and workload in the embryology laboratory ( 19 ) . \\n the biggest issue with pre - implantation viability assessment is that due to ethical reasons any assay should be completely non - invasive because no one can predict what kind of interference would be the unwanted result in the later embryonic development . \\n the most apparent  and routinely applied - way of the assessment of viability is the morphological evaluation of in vitro fertilized embryos using microscopy . \\n there are several morphological features described which could be used for viability assessment purposes , these are dependent on the time spent after fertilization . right after fertilization in the 1-cell embryo the size and symmetry of the two pronuclei can be examined . \\n the time of the first cell division is also a good predictor of later implantation potential , as zygotes that divide early tend to develop more frequently to the blastocyst stage . \\n criteria as cleavage rate and blastomere shape and symmetry , an adequate trophectoderm layer ( te ) and an inner cell mass ( icm ) is a morphological marker of the later stages ( 5,20 ) . \\n not only can the morphology of the fertilized embryo be used for further prediction of implantation potential , but morphological defects of the retrieved oocyte as well . fertilization and pregnancy rate correlates with the grade of cumulus - oocyte complexes , and embryos originating from dysmorphic oocytes show a larger grade of pregnancy loss ( 21 - 23 ) . \\n the cleavage stages of morulae and blastocysts or the symmetry and patterns of cell division are also notable and frequently used aspects , and are often examined during the prediction of embryo viability ( 23 ) . \\n the biggest issue of morphological assessment is that it is still a highly subjective method ( 20 ) . \\n the reason is partly due to the fact that the final decision is made by a clinician , and not by an objective test result , and secondly it is does matter how important are the individual morphological features in the final conclusion ( 24 - 26 ) . to overcome the different practice of laboratories worldwide in 2011 an international consensus ( istanbul consensus ) has been reached on embryo viability assessment ( 27 ) \\n . the selected morphological markers of respective stage embryos , the weighing of individual features and a scoring system has been set up . \\n the limitations due to static time - point observation , is now solved with the use of time - lapse microscopy ( 28,29 ) . \\n time - lapse microscopy also enables the observation of dynamics of cytoplasmic movements and cytokinesis , reflecting the functionality of microtubule and actin cytoskeleton , which is critical for proper development . in our laboratory \\n , we aimed to improve the success rate of implantation by adopting and further optimizing the istanbul consensus . \\n this score has been called as the optimized criteria system ( ocs ) . according to this scoring \\n , 3-day old embryos were divided into two subgroups : the subgroup with low blastomere number ( less than 7 ) and with high blastomere number ( 7 or more ) . \\n symmetric position of blastomeres indicates the rate of symmetry of holoblastic cleavage along the embryo axis . \\n it was classified as good ( full symmetry ) ; fair ( light asymmetry ) ; or poor ( evident asymmetry ) . \\n the percent values of fragmentation are based on the ratio of fragmented to total cell numbers . as a further modification to the istanbul consensus , \\n embryos were considered as good if the fragmentation rate was < 15% ( instead of the original 10% ) . \\n this shift from 10 to 15% was the result of our observation that a fairly high proportion of the embryos between 10 - 15% appeared to be viable . in summary the optimized criteria system ( ocs ) \\n highlights 3 modified or new parameters : fragmentation ( with a more permissive criterion of < 15% in the  good  category ) ; symmetry and the blastomere number . in addition , the blastomere size was evaluated according to the original istanbul consensus . \\n a scoring - map was created to facilitate the evaluation ( table 1 ) as far as the 5-day old embryos are concerned , we modified the original istanbul consensus for blastocysts by leaving out the hatched stage from the evaluation . \\n the istanbul consensus for the 5-day old embryos has a shortcoming , i.e. it does not express the viability of embryos with a single category ( good , fair , poor ) . \\n we tried to overcome this by using a scoring map ( table 2 ) . in conclusion \\n , we constructed a composite score for day-3 , as well as day-5 old embryos , based on morphological parameters . \\n as it is evident from the results , this composite score is sensitive to evaluate viability ( figure 1 ) \\n another possibility for non - invasive embryo viability assessment is the metabolomic examination of the culture medium surrounding the in vitro fertilized embryo . \\n metabolomic , ( proteomic ) profiling of spent embryo culture ( sec ) offers an exceptional , non - invasive opportunity for the assessment of embryo viability ( 30,31 ) . \\n the metabolomic profiling ( 32,33 ) of early embryo development might mean the analysis of the total metabolome by following the changes of several selected compounds , metabolomic analysis using unidentified , but significantly differing metabolomic changes , or by the analysis of a limited population of nutrients or end products . \\n the common feature in all three concepts is that they are concentrating on the metabolomic alterations caused by differently developing embryos in the culture medium . \\n very simple idea is the monitoring of glucose consumption or pyruvate formation , since this would directly indicate the metabolism of the developing embryo and it is an obvious conclusion that a metabolically active embryo would have higher implantation potential . \\n some authors reported that the identification of these parameters resulted in successful prediction of embryo implantation potential , but other research groups describe contradictory results ( 34 , 35 ) . \\n the amino acid profile of culture media is also used in the prediction of implantation potential , though not exclusively as an independent parameter , rather in combination with morphological features ( 36 ) . \\n the detection of unidentified metabolomic changes using near infra - red ( nir ) or raman spectroscopy ( 37 , 38 ) is a very interesting and challenging possibility . \\n more complicated is the concept when unknown , new biomarker molecules of embryo viability are searched for , assuming that these biomarkers were secreted by the embryo . \\n the difficulty of the concept is that only 4 - 8 cells are present in the culture medium ; thus a very sensitive analytical tool is required . \\n mass spectrometry ( ms ) has the potential of specific and sensitive quantification in a wide spectrum of molecular mass ranges and therefore suites well the needs of metabolomic or proteomic fingerprinting and quantification . in parallel to the spreading of mass spectrometry , proteomics is also an emerging field in the understanding of embryo development ( 39,40 ) . \\n the analysis of the embryonic secretome ( 41,42 ) provides information of the total transcriptome of the developing embryos . \\n mass spectrometry can be used both in targeted and discovery analysis with accurate quantification of identified biomarkers after molecular identification by bottom - up or top - down proteomics using tandem or multiple ms ( 43 - 46 ) . in a recent publication from our laboratory ( 47 ) using liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometry ( lc - ms ) , a fragment of the human haptoglobin molecule was identified in the culture medium . rather than analyzing the embryonic secretome , the aim this experiment was to use preexisting molecules present in the cell culture media as biomarkers . \\n haptoglobin - which was detected in the culture medium - is not a product of the developing embryo ; the polypeptide is a contaminant of the human serum albumin standard used to supplement the culture medium ( 47,48 ) . during the first three days of embryo development the formation of a subunit ( alfa-1 ) of the human haptoglobin molecule was observed . \\n this subunit similar to the total haptoglobin molecule was detectable in the blank control medium samples as well . \\n the differentiation of the viable and non - viable embryos was done using the observation that compared to blank controls the samples of embryos which later did not resulted in pregnancy contained the alpha-1 subunit in a much larger quantity than the samples of embryos which did ( figure 2 ) . \\n clinical statistical analysis of the results revealed that the specificity of the diagnostic test was 64% , while the sensitivity was 100% . \\n it is more informative that the positive predictive value of the assay was 51% and  maybe more importantly  the negative predictive value was 100% . \\n receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) analysis provides tools to select possibly optimal models and to discard suboptimal ones . \\n roc analysis is related in a direct and natural way to cost / benefit analysis of diagnostic decision - making \\n . the roc curve of the morphological versus metabolomic approach in relation to the correct prediction of pregnancy outcome is illustrated in figure 3 . \\n it is obvious that our biochemical investigation method enables a selection of the embryos by sorting out the non - viable ones . \\n the test selected with 100% potential the embryos , which did not lead to successful implantation at all . \\n one of the areas of collaboration between clinicians , the clinical laboratory and the research laboratory at the university of pcs is related to the research of infertility . since the clinical background gives the beauty and the medical importance of laboratory research , it was of outstanding importance for us to receive the eflm - abbott diagnostics award for excellence in outcomes research in laboratory medicine ( paris , 2015 ) , the award given to the best published paper ( 47 ) , as judged by an independent panel of experts , which demonstrates improved outcomes arising out of the application or improved utilization of an in - vitro diagnostics test .', 'leaf senescence is the last phase of plant development and a highly coordinated process regulated by a large number of senescence associated genes ( sags ) ( 12 ) . \\n leaf senescence can either be naturally induced during development stages , or stimulated by environmental factors including darkness , nutritional deficiency and various stresses ( 13 ) . \\n premature senescence is an important factor leading to the decrease of crop yield and quality , which becomes an increasing concern due to the global climate change in the recent years . \\n many advances in the understanding of leaf senescence at the molecular level had been achieved through the identification and characterization of hundreds of sags and senescence - related mutants in arabidopsis thaliana , lycopersicon esculentum and nicotiana tabaccum ( 14 ) . \\n microarray expression profiling in arabidopsis revealed that more than 800 genes are up - regulated during the course of leaf senescence ( 5 ) . among them , more than 200 transcription factors , including wrky , nac , mads , myb , bzip and bhlh family members , are involved in the regulation of leaf senescence , indicating that leaf senescence is governed by complex transcriptional regulatory networks . \\n molecular and genetic studies of leaf senescence in recent years led to the accumulation of a large volume of scattered information related to sags . \\n the construction of a leaf senescence related database with wide - spread collection and systematic annotation of sags may provide a useful resource and a good starting point for the further study of the molecular aspects of leaf senescence . \\n some initial efforts to this end had been made ; including the online website of plant senescence network ( sennet ) constructed by thomas and his colleagues ( http://www.sidthomas.net/plant_senescence/ ) and the corresponding senwiki web pages ( http://www.sidthomas.net/senwiki/ ) . \\n sennet brings together various community information including meetings , laboratories , websites and useful links related to plant senescence , while senwiki provides general information and knowledge of senescence with texts and images . \\n however , a wide - ranging compilation and detailed annotation of known sags that would be of great help and demand to the systemic study of leaf senescence at the molecular level has yet to be done . in this regard , \\n we have developed a leaf senescence database ( lsd ) ( http://www.eplantsenescence.org/ ) by retrieving and integrating information from research papers and public databases . at present \\n 1145 sags from 21 species were manually curated and categorized into several groups according to their function . \\n users can browse the entries in the database to obtain information including literatures , mutants , phenotypes , expression profiles , mirna interactions , orthologs in other plants and cross links to protein domain and family databases . \\n users can also search the database easily through the  text search interface with locus names , keywords and author names , etc . \\n we have implemented the blast tool kit for sequence similarity search against nucleotide or protein sequences of these sags in the lsd . a major feature of the lsd is the integration of a bioinformatics platform weblab we had developed previously ( 6 ) , which allows users to perform extensive sequence analysis of the sags they are interested in . \\n all the sag sequences are freely available for downloading . help information including user guides , a tutorials and faqs are also available online . \\n we plan to identify putative sags from completely sequenced genomes and add them into the database in the near future , and improve the user interface based on user feedback , provide more help documents with case studies , add more links to other useful sites , and update the database in time with more leaf senescence related data available . \\n we hope that lsd could be a useful resource for the leaf senescence research community , as well as a gateway for the collaborative project we are working with both domestic and international colleagues . \\n we made an extensive literature survey and collected approximately 200 leaf senescence related papers published before october 2010 on major plant biology journals including plant cell , plant physiology , plant journal , new phytologist , journal of experimental botany , among others . \\n a total of 1145 sags from 21 species including arabidopsis , rice and so on , were identified and manually verified based on genetic , genomic , proteomic , physiological and other experimental evidence . among them , \\n 96 and 58 genes were supported by mutational investigation or transgenic over - expression study , respectively ( table 1 ) . \\n table 1.number of sags and mutants in 21 speciesspeciescommon

were also retrieved from literatures . \\n expression profiling data were acquired from a classical and systemic research paper ( 5 ) . \\n in addition to manual curation , computational approaches were also employed to annotate these sags . \\n we predicted the potential mirna targets for the sags using the rnahybrid method ( 7 ) . \\n the orthologs of each sag in other plants were retrieved from the online database orthomcl - db ( 8) . finally , putative function domains of sags - encoding proteins were identified with interproscan ( 9 ) . \\n to meet the general requirement of data analysis , we integrated the sequence similarity search tool blast ( 10 ) and the sequence analysis platform weblab ( 6 ) into our leaf senescence database . \\n users can either retrieve the sequence from lsd , or upload their own sequences to search homologs against different divisions ( gene , mrna , cds and protein ) in the lsd . \\n weblab is a web - based bioinformatics platform developed by our center and publicly available worldwide ( http://www.weblab.org.cn/ ) ( 6 ) . \\n a user space is provided to save input data and analysis results for registered users . \\n users may retrieve sequence data and submit to weblab directly to perform extensive analysis for dna , mrna and protein sequences of the sags they are interested in . \\n the lsd database enables users to retrieve and analyze sags through the browse or search page . \\n users may browse the entries by clicking the buttons of species , mutants or phenotypes at the main page . \\n a tree - like structure was designed for both species and phenotypes , and a table was created for mutants . currently , the major source of sags was from the two model organisms a. thaliana ( 949 entries ) and oryza sativa ( 104 entries ) . \\n the phenotypes of all sags were divided into the following groups : ( i ) natural senescence , ( ii ) dark induced senescence , ( iii ) nutrition deficiency induced senescence , ( iv ) stress induced senescence and ( v ) others . \\n the text search interface allows users to make queries with three types of data : ( i ) locus name , genbank i d , alias , species and description of genes ; ( ii ) name , type and ecotype of mutants ; and ( iii ) title , author , journal and date of literature papers . \\n figure 1 shows the annotation for a typical lsd entry ntl9 , a member of the nac

was retrieved from the literature . \\n functional category , effect and evidence of senescence , as well as a brief description of this gene were manually annotated ( figure 1a ) . \\n expression profiles generated from microarray data can be found for most arabidopsis sags ( figure 1c ) . \\n we predicted potential mirna targets for some sags and added links to mirbase ( 12 ) for these mirnas ( figure 2a ) . \\n orthologs from other plants are listed with links to the orthomcl database ( figure 2b ) . \\n putative functional domains of proteins encoded by sags were identified and annotated using the interproscan program ( 9 ) , and matches were displayed with cross links to several protein domain and family databases such as prosite and pfam ( figure 2c ) . \\n ( a ) basic information ,

these links to bring up the corresponding sequence and submit it to weblab for further analysis , such as predicting gene structures , making pairwise or multiple sequence alignment , generating sequence logos , constructing phylogenetic trees , finding sequence motifs , etc . \\n we will update the database regularly with more leaf senescence related data available , and predict putative sags from completely sequenced plant genomes in the near future . \\n we will improve the user interface with comments and suggestions from the user community and add more documents including case studies to help user to make thorough analysis of sags . \\n we hope that lsd can be a platform not only for the domestic and international collaborators we are working with , but also for the

control subjects ( 7 ) . \\n cases for the cross - sectional study ( baseline ) were recruited from a regional tertiary hospital pediatric diabetes center and from endocrinology practices in western new york . at the time of the initial study , the diabetes center followed over 600 patients aged 221 years with type 1 diabetes . \\n female patients aged 1321 years in that clinical center were offered the opportunity to participate in the baseline study ( n = 138 ) . \\n recruitment of older women involved contacting former center patients ( aged > 21 years ) , patients from regional endocrinology practices , and affected relatives of subjects screened by our diabetes center for the diabetes prevention trial . \\n the comparison group included young women recruited from the same region as the case subjects ; most were classmates or acquaintances of the case subjects or were volunteers who learned of the study through flyers posted at the university and hospital . \\n the baseline study enrolled 72 case subjects ( diabetes duration > 2 years ) and 91 control subjects aged 1337 years who were at least 2 years postmenarchal ( 7 ) . \\n all type 1 diabetic case subjects and nondiabetic control subjects who participated in the baseline study were recruited 2 years later to assess change in bmd over time . \\n contact was maintained with study participants between the baseline and follow - up exam via phone and mail . \\n inclusion criteria for the follow - up study were participation in the baseline study , current negative pregnancy test , and signed informed consent . for individuals younger than 18 years of age , \\n exclusion criteria for both the baseline and follow - up study included systemic illness affecting bmd ( other than diabetes ) , other endocrine disorders ( except autoimmune thyroiditis ) , and diagnosis of juvenile osteoporosis or other bone disease . \\n the study was approved by the institutional review boards of the women and children 's hospital of buffalo and the university at buffalo . at baseline \\n , study participants completed questionnaires relating to personal and family health , lifestyle habits , dietary intake ( food frequency questionnaire ) , and medication intake including use of calcium supplements . \\n participants also reported prior fracture history , menstrual history , and demographic information . for participants with type 1 diabetes , information on disease duration , insulin dose schedule ( injections versus continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ) , and diabetes complications were reported . \\n bmi was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters . \\n dexa ( hologic qdr-4500a ; hologic , waltham , ma ) was used to measure bmd in the anterior / posterior ( l14 ) spine , total hip , femoral neck , total forearm , and whole body . \\n a single technician performed all baseline scans and 65% of the follow - up scans ; two additional technicians performed the remainder of the follow - up scans ( 27% and 7% , respectively ) . \\n coefficients of variation ( cvs ) were determined for measures of all sites for all technicians throughout the study and were all < 1% throughout the study . \\n the following biomarkers were measured in nontimed blood samples : serum osteocalcin , igf-1 , igf binding protein ( igfbp)-3 ( by radioimmunoassay ) , and a1c ( by high - performance liquid chromatography with bio - rad variant ; bio - rad , richmond , ca ) . \\n random urinary n - teleopeptide levels were measured by enzyme - linked immuno - absorbent assay . \\n serum for hormonal assays was frozen at 80c and stored until sent for analysis in batches to esoterix laboratory ( calabasas hills , ca ) . \\n a1c ( fresh plasma ) was assayed in a sequential fashion at the women and children 's hospital of buffalo laboratory ( kaleida health ) . \\n intra - assay cv was < 3% for n - telopeptide , 6% for igf-1 and osteocalcin , and 13% for igfbp-3 . \\n interassay cv was < 7% for n - telopeptide , < 9.7% for igf-1 , 13% for osteocalcin , and < 17% for igfbp-3 ( esoterix laboratories ) . \\n data from study participants were analyzed in stratum based on age at initial enrollment ( 7 ) . \\n demographic , lifestyle , metabolic characteristics , and bmd were compared between diabetic case subjects and nondiabetic control subjects , stratified by age . \\n comparisons were made for baseline differences , differences at follow - up , and percent change between the two time points . \\n results were presented as both unadjusted comparisons and comparisons of adjusted means ( adjusted for age , bmi , and oral contraceptive [ oc ] use ) . \\n unadjusted differences for continuous variables were examined using student 's t test and for categorical variables using the  test . \\n data analyses were performed using sas version 8 ( sas , cary , nc ) . \\n post hoc power analysis of follow - up total hip bmd ( adjusted for age , bmi , and oc use ) indicated that our dataset of 63 case subjects ( n = 37 , < 20 years of age ) and 85 control subjects ( n = 36 , < 20 years of age ) gave our study 80% power to detect a difference between case and control subjects with an  of 0.05 and a target effect size of 0.45 in women < 20 years of age and 0.63 in those > 20 years of age . \\n table 1 includes baseline and follow - up characteristics of women who participated in this follow - up study . for comparative purposes , \\n the follow - up group included 63 women with type 1 diabetes ( 58.7% < 20 years of age ) and 85 control subjects without diabetes ( 42.4% < 20 years of age ) at ages 1539 years at enrollment . \\n of the participants in the baseline study with diabetes , 87.5% ( 63 of 72 ) participated in this follow - up study , and 93.4% ( 85 of 91 ) of control subjects participated in both examinations . \\n more subjects from the baseline cohort 20 years of age were lost to follow - up ( 13.8 vs. 3.94% , cohort < 20 years of age ) , with the highest attrition being from individuals with diabetes 20 years of age ( 21.2% ) . \\n participants in this follow - up study were predominantly non - hispanic caucasian ( 95% ) and were similar in age at menarche and years since menarche . \\n participants 20 years of age with diabetes used oc therapy longer than control subjects ( p  0.05 ) . although few participants were smokers , more women with diabetes reported current smoking ; there were no smokers among the control subjects < 20 years of age . at follow - up , \\n women with diabetes , particularly the older women , continued to have higher bmi than control subjects . weight change ( in percent ) was not significantly different over the follow - up period . \\n as reported previously , more patients in the older cohort were using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( p < 0.01 , data not shown ) . while a trend toward lower daily insulin requirement was present in the older cohort ( 0.86  0.42 vs. 0.75  0.22 units  kg  day ) , that difference was not statistically significant . \\n subjects 20 years of age were more likely to have diabetes - related complications , although no statistical differences were found . \\n table 2 presents bmd values at baseline and follow - up for each body site measured . \\n unadjusted means and means adjusted for age , bmi , and oc use are shown stratified by age - group and diabetes diagnosis . in those < 20 years of age \\n , both case and control subjects had an increase in bmd over the 2-year interval . the percent increase in bmd from baseline to follow - up was not statistically different between younger subjects and control subjects . \\n for all participants in the population 20 years of age , the bmd from baseline to follow - up remained stable . \\n significant differences in bmd were identified at the total hip , femoral neck , and whole body in the case subjects 20 years of age compared with the control subjects . as in the previous report , no differences in bmd were seen between groups in the younger cohort . in the adjusted model ( for age , bmi , and oc use ) , bmd values at the total hip ( baseline , p = 0.003 ; follow - up , p = 0.007 ) and femoral neck ( baseline and follow - up , p < \\n 0.001 ) were significantly lower in older women with diabetes compared with control subjects . after adjustment , the whole - body bmd was no longer significantly different between case and control subjects ; however , both age - groups showed a trend toward lower whole - body bmd in the case subjects . \\n further adjustment for dietary intake of calcium and vitamin d as well as physical activity did not alter the bmd results ( data not shown ) . \\n when the analysis was restricted to nonsmokers , the adjusted means changed very little . for the older cohort , however , \\n the p values were attenuated for the total hip ( p = 0.017 ) and whole body ( p = 0.215 ) . in nonsmokers \\n > 20 years of age , the percent change difference at the total hip became more pronounced between case and control subjects and reached statistical significance ( p = 0.008 ) . \\n overall , igf-1 levels were lower for all groups compared with baseline ( table 3 ) . \\n this is consistent with a physiologic decrease in igf-1 in postteenage years ( esoterix normative data 11 ) . at the 2-year follow - up , however , the igf-1 level was significantly lower in the younger diabetic subjects than in the control subjects , although still within the normal range . \\n igf-1 levels were not statistically different between diabetic participants and control subjects in the older cohort . within the older age - group , igfbp-3 levels were lower in participants with diabetes than in control subjects ( p < 0.05 ) . \\n igfbp-3 levels were comparable for control and diabetic subjects in the cohort < 20 years of age . \\n serum osteocalcin levels were lower at follow - up for all groups , even with increased bone mineral accrual in the group < 20 years of age ( table 3 ) . \\n there was no difference in osteocalcin or n - teleopeptide levels between case and control subjects < 20 years of age ( table 3 ) . \\n after adjusting for age and bmi , case subjects had significantly lower osteocalcin levels than control subjects in the population 20 years of age ( p < 0.04 ; table 3 ) . \\n in addition , the percent change in osteocalcin level from baseline to follow - up was significantly different in diabetic women 20 years of age compared with control subjects after adjustment ( p < 0.03 ) . markers of bone formation did not correlate with bmd in our subjects . \\n metabolic control , as measured by a1c , was poorer in the younger diabetic cohort , as we reported previously ( 7 ) . \\n overall metabolic control was stable within a given age stratum between the baseline and follow - up studies . \\n no correlation was found between a1c and any of the bmd measurements ( data not presented ) . \\n when evaluating for associations between metabolic control and bmd measurements that were statistically lower in case than in control subjects at follow - up ( table 2 ) , the pearson correlation coefficient ( r value ) for a1c and bmd was between 0.121 ( total hip ) and 0.334 ( femoral neck ) ( p > 0.095 , data not shown ) . \\n as in our previous study , there was no association found between bmd and diabetes duration , baseline a1c , or years since menarche . \\n while longitudinal studies have examined the effect of insulin therapy on bmd in patients with long - standing type 1 diabetes ( 12 ) , few have reported on the natural history of metabolic bone disease in younger women . here \\n we present bmd data for a well - characterized cohort of young women with type 1 diabetes at baseline and 2 years later . \\n the baseline study demonstrated that the older cohort had significantly lower bmd at the femoral neck and lateral spine than age - matched control subjects ( 7 ) . \\n the data presented here demonstrate that case subjects in the older cohort had persistently lower bmd than age - matched healthy control subjects . in this cohort , \\n bmd at the total hip and femoral neck remained lower than in control subjects after adjusting for age , bmi , and oc use , even with no significant decrease in bmd from baseline to follow - up ( table 2 ) . \\n similar to our initial study , there was no difference in bmd between women with diabetes aged < 20 years and control subjects at any of the sites measured . \\n however , there was a trend toward lower bmd at the total hip and whole body in women with diabetes . \\n this difference occurred in the face of bmd increases ( percent change ) at both the total hip and whole body in this population , suggesting that bone mineral accrual is altered in a subtle manner during late adolescence in women with type 1 diabetes . \\n individuals with type 2 diabetes have higher than average bmd compared with control subjects ( 13 ) , in part due to the mechanical load of obesity . in our study , women with type 1 diabetes had higher bmi than control subjects . \\n however , bmd continued to be lower in older women with type 1 diabetes , even after adjusting for bmi ; thus , overweight status does not confer protection against poor bone mineralization in these young women . \\n although the younger cohort had poorer diabetes control than the older cohort , we were again unable to demonstrate an association between bmd measures and metabolic control , as measured by a1c . others have reported similar findings with respect to bmd in children and adolescents with diabetes ( 14 ) . \\n a1c measures short - term diabetes control ; perhaps cumulative life - time glycemic control is a better indicator of osteoporotic risk . \\n this hypothesis is supported by studies demonstrating that decreased lumbar spine and femoral neck bmd in adults with type 1 diabetes is associated with retinopathy , nephropathy , and peripheral neuropathy , all of which are long - term complications of poor metabolic control ( 1517 ) . \\n in addition , our data did not find a correlation between diabetes duration and bmd , further supporting a possible relation to lifetime diabetes control . \\n the adverse effects of chronic hyperglycemia related to osteoblast function , osteoclast activity , and formation of advanced glycosylated end products that may impact bone quality as well as bone quantity ( 18 ) are difficult to measure in a systematic fashion . \\n the role of insulin as a direct anabolic agent in bone metabolism is unclear ( 19 ) . \\n animal models of spontaneous and pharmacologically induced diabetes demonstrate that as insulinopenia develops , there is a suppression of osteoblast markers ( 20 ) . \\n it has been postulated that in addition to insulinopenia , relative igf-1 deficiency , whether systemic or local , contributes to low bmd in diabetes . \\n igf-1 levels are lower in individuals with type 1 diabetes , and poor glycemic control negatively impacts igf-1 production by the liver . in adults with type 1 diabetes , igf-1 levels were lower in individuals with osteopenia at the femoral neck ( 1 ) . \\n additionally , in a study of 127 children ( aged 620 years ) with diabetes , low bone mineral content correlated with low igf-1 levels ( 9 ) . in our study , igf-1 levels of case subjects were significantly lower than those of control subjects only for the younger cohort . \\n however , igf-1 levels of subjects with diabetes were lower in the group 20 years of age compared with the group < 20 years of age , and igfbp-3 levels in the older cohort were significantly lower compared with control subjects . given that no biochemical markers of bone metabolism correlated with bmd at the hip or femoral neck in our study , it could be hypothesized that a cumulative history of insulinopenia and low igf-1 levels are better correlates for low bone density . \\n our data demonstrate significant differences in bmd at the femoral neck and total hip that are likely to be clinically significant and may explain why women with type 1 diabetes have an increased risk of hip fractures later in life ( 4,5 ) . \\n our data also indicate that alterations in bone mineral accrual occur within years of achievement of peak bone mass and that there is not a later period of  catch - up  bone mineralization . \\n the most clinically relevant factor is whether a decrease in bmd correlates with fracture risk , which can not be determined in this study . besides bmd , multiple factors impact fracture risk including , but not limited to , age , nutrition status , smoking history , degree of frailty , and fracture history ( 21 ) . \\n the well - characterized population , the large percentage of women who participated in the follow - up study , and the standard procedures used in this longitudinal study all represent significant strengths . \\n yet , we acknowledge certain limitations . the study population is small , limiting its ability to detect true differences that may still exist . \\n study control subjects were community based and may not represent the general population of women . \\n finally , the results presented should be interpreted keeping in mind that multiple comparisons were made . \\n we are aware of the lack of unanimity of opinion regarding the statistical approach when adjusting the statistical testing for many comparisons ( 22 ) . \\n because many of our hypotheses are nested , and not independent , we feel that using a bonferroni approach is overly conservative . \\n however , we have interpreted our results with caution and believe they are stronger when considered as a whole rather than as independent statistical tests . \\n our findings demonstrate lower bmd in young women with type 1 diabetes compared with control subjects . \\n although bone density testing is not routinely performed in young women , these data suggest that screening may be important in young women with type 1 diabetes . \\n in addition , these women should be counseled regarding lifestyle interventions that may improve bone health , including adequate intake of calcium and vitamin d , and exercise .\", 'many studies have shown that bracket debonding can cause enamel loss , particularly when the fracture occurs at the enamel - adhesive interface \\n . enamel damage may be in the form of enamel cracks , which may propagate during debonding [ 13 ] . \\n acid - etching , rinsing , drying and applying resin and bonding agents are the routine steps of conventional orthodontic bracket bonding . \\n concurrent with studies on the efficacy of the conventional technique , many studies , aimed at reducing the number of steps necessary for adhesion , have examined new bonding techniques with clinically adequate bond strength but less etching depth [ 56 ] . \\n traditional methods of bonding orthodontic brackets to teeth rely on acid etching to achieve adequate retention . \\n however , maintaining a sound enamel surface after bracket removal is of primary concern to clinicians . \\n bond failure at the bracket - adhesive interface or within the adhesive is generally considered \\n safer  than a fracture at the enamel - adhesive interface ; this is because studies have demonstrated that enamel fracture can occur during debonding . on the other hand , \\n if a considerable amount of adhesive remains on the tooth surface after debonding , more chair time is required to remove the residual adhesive . \\n in addition , the process of removing the residual adhesive results in further enamel loss . \\n all - purpose or multi - purpose , self - adhesive resin cements are now commercially available in the market . \\n they are capable of bonding to different substrates such as enamel , dentin , amalgam , metal and porcelain [ 910 ] . \\n these cements require no surface pre - treatment due to their monomer and filler content and initiation technology . \\n the phosphoric acid methacrylates react with basic fillers in the luting cement and the hydroxyapatite of the tooth structure [ 1112 ] . \\n these self - adhesive cements do not require an  etch and rinse  phase as they are capable of conditioning the tooth surface and simultaneously preparing it for adhesion . \\n this not only shortens the clinical application time , but also significantly reduces technique - sensitivity and risk of errors during application or manipulation . \\n the aim of the current study was to assess the enamel cracks after debonding of brackets bonded with two different adhesive systems and also to evaluate enamel cracks after removing adhesive remnants and enamel polishing . \\n sixty upper central incisors , extracted due to periodontal disease , were selected and stored in normal saline at room temperature until required . \\n the study design was approved by the ethics committee of mashhad university of medical sciences . using a stereomicroscope ( blue light industry , waltham , ma , usa ) and digital camera ( exwave had , sony corporation , japan ) a magnified image ( 23.9x ) \\n the number of enamel cracks and the length and direction of each crack were assessed with the aid of adobe photoshop cs software ( adobe systems incorporate , usa ) ( figure 1 ) . \\n enamel cracks before bracket bonding ( a ) , after deboning ( b ) and after polishing ( c ) . \\n new cracks are hatched . the number of visible cracks ( i.e. cracks visible to the naked eye ) was also recorded . \\n the teeth were then randomly divided into two equal groups . in the first group , the buccal surface of each central incisor \\n a standard edgewise twin metal bracket ( dentaurum , pforzheim , germany ) was bonded with transbond xt ( 3 m , usa ) to the center of the labial surface of each tooth . in the second group , \\n the same bracket was bonded with self - adhesive composite cement ( maxcem elite , kerr , usa ) . in both groups , \\n the adhesive was cured for 40 seconds ( 10 seconds on each side of the bracket ) . \\n the teeth were then incubated in distilled water at 37c for 24 hours to allow the material to set . \\n all the brackets were debonded with rmo i-546 remover pliers ( rmo , germany ) . \\n the blades of the pliers were placed at the bracket - adhesive interface and a gentle squeezing force was applied to the pliers by a zwick / z250 at a speed of 0.5 mm / min until bond failure occurred . \\n the present method of force application was modified from a diametric compression test for tension that indirectly measures tensile strength . \\n this approach was used because it simulates the usual clinical method for applying debonding forces . \\n the debonding force recorded by the zwick is not equal to the actual force applied at the bracket adhesive interface because the force was applied at a predetermined distance on the pliers beaks . \\n these forces , however , are proportional and can be expressed in the following ratio : the actual force ( f ) equals the measured force ( f ) multiplied by ( a ) divided by ( b ) : f= f ( a / b ) . in this ratio , ( a ) \\n is the distance from the point of force application to the fulcrum of the pliers and ( b ) is the distance from the point of actual force application to the fulcrum of the pliers . \\n deboning force was measured in newton and was then converted to megapascal ( mpa ) . \\n after debonding , the buccal surfaces of the teeth in each group were examined by the same stereomicroscope and the magnified images ( 23.9 x ) were taken with the same digital camera . the number of enamel cracks and the length and the direction of each crack were assessed with the aid of the same software . \\n a : the distance from the point of force application to the fulcrum of the pliers . \\n b : the distance from the point of actual force application to the fulcrum of the pliers the number of visible cracks in each tooth was also recorded ( figure 1 ) . \\n the adhesive remnants on each tooth were then assessed with the ari in a 03 scale : 0 indciates no composite left on the tooth ; 1 indicates less than half of the composite left on the tooth , 2 indicates that more than half of the composite is left on the tooth surface and 3 shows that all the composite is left on the tooth surface with a distinct impression of the bracket base . \\n the buccal surface of each tooth was polished with 12-blade tungsten carbide bur ( g&h , usa ) under water coolant . \\n the enamel surface was examined for the third time in the same way ( figure 1 ) . \\n the amount of shear bond strength in each group was compared with independent t - test . \\n the enamel cracks in each group were compared before bonding , after debonding and after polishing using repeated measures anova . \\n friedman and mann - whitney tests were applied in case of non - normal distribution of data . \\n the result of the independent t - test indicated that the mean shear bond strength of maxcem elite ( the self - adhesive composite cement ) was significantly lower than that of transbond xt ( the adhesive composite ) ( p<0.001 ) . \\n the mean sbs of maxcem elite and transbond xt was 10.291.14 and 11.481.09 , respectively . \\n there were no significant inter - group differences in the number of enamel cracks before debonding . \\n there were significantly more enamel cracks in the transbond xt group after debonding and polishing compared to the maxcem elite group . in the maxcem elite group , the difference in the number of enamel cracks before and after debonding was statistically significant ( p<0.001 ) . \\n the difference , however , was not significant after debonding and after polishing ( p=0.06 ) . \\n the number of visible enamel cracks followed a similar pattern . in each group , before and after debonding , a significant intra \\n sd : standard deviation significant difference significant difference between a and b ( wilcoxon test ) however , before and after polishing , the difference was not significant ( table 2 ) . \\n sd : standard deviation significant difference significant difference between a and b ( wilcoxon test ) there was no significant difference in the length of enamel

composite left on the tooth ; 3 , all the composite left on the tooth with a distinct impression of the bracket base ) \\n the main objective of this study was to evaluate the enamel cracks after debonding brackets , bonded with two different bonding systems followed by polishing . \\n the sbs of maxcem elite , a self - adhesive cement , and transbond xt , a conventional adhesive composite , was also compared . \\n the number and length of enamel cracks before bonding , after debonding and after polishing were also compared as well as the ari following the removal of orthodontic brackets . before bonding \\n zacchrison et al .   showed that debonding of brackets created enamel cracks , which were different in size and direction . \\n reported a significant increase in the number and length of enamel cracks after debonding with different pliers . \\n stated that 82% of the teeth studied did not show significant increase in the number of enamel cracks after debonding and the teeth showing increased number of cracks had significantly greater mean bond strength . after polishing , \\n the number and length of enamel cracks increased in all groups , although there were no differences among the groups . according to zarrinnia et al . \\n , debonding pliers cause resin fracture at the adhesive - bracket interface and using a tungsten carbide bur , accompanied by water coolant , effectively removes all adhesive remnants . \\n they showed that the smoothest surface was obtained with the gloss polishing paste . a direct correlation between ari and bond strength \\n the current study found significant differences among the ari scores and concluded that , in the transbond xt group , debonding was mostly of cohesive type , in contrast to the adhesive mode in the maxcem elite group . \\n reported that self - adhesive cements had satisfactory bond strength to dentin and restorative materials , but that their bond strength to enamel was weak . \\n vicente et al .   showed that relyxunicem ( a self - adhesive resin cement ) possessed a significantly lower bond strength than transbond xt . \\n reported low bond strength for relyxunicem and suggested that the sbs of this self - adhesive universal cement needs to be increased for its successful use in bonding orthodontic brackets . \\n .   showed that one - component adhesives ( relyxunicem and maxcem ) had significantly lower sbs than two- or three - component adhesives . \\n bishara et al .   reported that maxcem had significantly lower bond strength than transbond xt . in the current study , maxcem elite ( a new self - adhesive system ) \\n the mean bond strength in the transbond xt group was significantly greater than that in the maxcem elite group , although the sbs of the latter was 10.291.14 mpa , which is clinically acceptable . \\n debonding brackets bonded with maxcem elite resulted in less enamel cracks . removing remnants of adhesives and polishing with a 12-blade tungsten carbide bur did not increase enamel cracks . \\n maxcem elite has clinically acceptable bond strength and can be used as a routine adhesive for orthodontic purposes .', \"sensitive skin syndrome is a common and challenging condition , yet little is known about its underlying pathophysiology . \\n sensitive skin is a common term used by patients and clinicians , as well as the cosmetic industry , and represents a complex clinical challenge faced by dermatologists and other skin care professionals . \\n patients with sensitive skin often present with subjective complaints that are out of proportion to the objective clinical findings . \\n the patients complain of severe facial irritation , burning , and/or stinging after application of cosmetic products and toiletries such as sunscreens and soaps , yet they do not demonstrate the clinical stigmata of scaling , induration , and/or erythema that would be expected in known inflammatory or allergic processes . \\n the condition is often worsened by specific climatic conditions and may affect areas other than the face . \\n maibach described the cosmetic intolerance syndrome ( cis ) , which probably covers the bulk of the clinical presentation of the sensitive skin syndrome ( sss ) . \\n fisher is credited with coining the term status cosmeticus to describe one extreme of the natural history of the cis in which the patient gradually becomes completely intolerant to the application of any cosmetic product . \\n fundamentally , sss is a state of hyperreactivity to environmental stimuli , presenting with a clear clinical picture and resulting from a single underlying pathology or a combination of pathologies . \\n defined as a self - diagnosed condition , sss is by definition difficult to quantify . \\n some of the contradictions between investigators could be explained by flawed methodologies since the scientific community has yet to identify an acceptable objective screening test for sensitive skin . \\n however , it is not only the subjective nature of the complaints that make sss difficult to diagnose . \\n robinson , by performing patch testing with sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) and looking for intra - individual response patterns , found that there is significant positive correlation between sds and other irritants but noted overall low correlation coefficients . \\n he therefore deduced that it is inappropriate to define a subject 's reaction to a chemical based on his or her response to another irritant . \\n she skin - tested 58 subjects with history of strong positive sds or lactic acid response . \\n sds- or lactic acid - positive group , a reaction to one irritant could not predict a reaction with another . to further complicate matters \\n there is evidence to suggest that no correlation exists between the lactic acid stinging test and the response to sds . \\n this data resonate the idea that even the reference irritants commonly used in studies of this topic do not correlate with each other and with hyperreactivity tendencies . \\n finally , judge tested 22 nonatopic adults with varying doses of sds and found marked inter - individual variation in the response threshold . \\n this complexityreinforces the need for a thorough diagnostic algorithm and , specifically , the need to test patients with multiple , repeated and complete ( i.e. all cosmetics applied by the patient at home ) patch testing before making a diagnosis . \\n in order to formulate a systematic clinical approach , the medical and cosmetic communities have attempted to characterize the condition . \\n lacking an objective screening test , investigators resorted to epidemiological studies using patient surveys . in a large epidemiological study in the uk ( \\n n = 2316 ) , a staggering 51.4% of women and 38.2% of men self - reported themselves as having sensitive skin . of note , \\n interestingly , atopy did not appear to predict self - perceived sensitivity in the participating women . \\n in addition , in the same study self - reports of sss symptoms were statistically over - represented in the  self - reported sensitive cohort compared to the  self - reported nonsensitive cohort . \\n this finding validates the link between self - perception of sensitive skin and neurosensory discomfort . \\n two recent studies in the us and europe made similar observations . in the us , \\n females were significantly more concerned about sensitive skin than men ; however , no age or ethnic differences were found . \\n the european study reported an overall sensitive skin prevalence of 38.4% and found no ethnic differences . \\n the european study , once again , demonstrated that people who reported having sensitive skin were significantly more likely to experience sss symptoms . of note , \\n both the american and european studies used large samples ( n = 994 and n = 4506 , respectively ) ; however , they were both limited by a phone survey methodology and the lack of any objective assessment . in light of the increased incidence of self - reported hypersensitivity in females , \\n he compared the patch test responses of 384 patients to sds as the positive control and found increased reactivity in males compared to females . \\n lammintausta tested seven males and seven females with sodium lauryl sulfate ( sls ) and then performed visual inspections , transepidermal water loss measurements , and dielectric water content measurements but like other investigators found no reactivity differences between males and females , adding to the overall controversy . \\n female self - perception of sensitivity is consistently increased compared to that of males , yet when put through objective reactivity testing the trend is unclear . \\n ethnic differences in skin reactivity have been explored through the years , leading to the clinical hypothesis that black skin is less reactive than caucasian skin , which is in turn less reactive than asian skin . however , an epidemiological telephone survey performed in the us ( n = 811 ) revealed similar incidence of self - reported sensitive skin across four major ethnic groups ( afro - americans , asians , euro- american , and hispanics ) . the incidence rate of 52% is comparable to the incidence found in the uk ( see above ) . \\n the investigators did , however , find minimally statistically significant ethnic differences in the self - reported triggers and symptoms of sensitivity : afro - americans reacted less to environmental and alcoholic triggers ; hispanics reacted less to alcohol ; asians reacted more to wind , spices , and alcohol ; and euro - american reacted more to wind . in terms of symptomology , statistically significant increase in recurrent itching on the face was noted in the asian population , and fewer euro - american avoided certain cosmetics due to skin reactivity . \\n these findings were supported in a critical literature review , which showed that the evidence supporting the ethnic difference hypothesis using objective tests rarely reaches statistical significance and is often biased by subjective endpoints . \\n recent data looking into age - related differences in hyperreactivity are showing more consistent results . \\n whorl performed patch testing with 34 irritants on 2776 patients and found that young patients were more reactive than old patients . \\n robinson 's findings also corroboratedthe trend towards increased reactivity in the young subjects compared to the old subjects . \\n the mechanism leading to the sss has been debated in the literature , but the leading hypothesis relates to increased stratum corneum permeability . \\n there is a known inverse relationship between corneocyte size and stratum corneum thickness and the permeability of the skin , and changes in this mechanical barrier result in abnormal skin penetration by irritants . \\n in addition , low levels of ceramides in the stratum corneum have been linked to increased severity of sls - induced irritant contact dermatitis , pointing toward barrier compromise in sensitive skin . \\n seidenari linked self - reported hyperreactivity to decreased skin capacitance ( indicating decreased water content ) , objectively suggesting increased absorption of irritants by the sensitive - skin population . in the same study , \\n increased erythema was objectively measured in hyperreacting subjects suggesting involvement of some baseline vascular component , and leading more recent investigators to propose the involvement of cutaneus sensory innervation in the pathogenesis of sss . \\n as with many syndromes , the management scheme presented here emphasizes the diagnostic framework [ table 1 ] . \\n the clinical approach to the sss demands a thorough process of eliminating obvious as well as more subtle diagnoses . \\n once the diagnosis is made , deriving the appropriate treatment becomes a relatively simple task . \\n note that since much of the mechanisms of sss are unknown , the clinician must be comfortable with a certain degree of ambiguity and uncertainty . underlying mechanisms of sensitive skin syndrome it is reasonable to organize the differential diagnosis by dividing sss into visible and invisible sss . \\n some dermatoses that most clinicians find simple to diagnose may have atypical presentation and as a result lack the  expected morphology . \\n eczema , atopic dermatitis , and rosacea are likely the three most common causes of sss related to barrier defect . \\n full discussion of these conditions is beyond the scope of this overview but we will highlight some common clinical features . \\n careful history , including family history and occupational history , combined with a detailed physical exam will often reveal the diagnosis . in the history \\n particular consideration should be given to culprits such as the masking effect of other topical agents applied by the patient . \\n the physical exam should include scrutiny of the face and scalp for subtle signs of minor inflammation , which are often masked in sss with underlying endogenous dermatoses . in all of these conditions \\n the patients are likely over - exfoliating their skin and thus exacerbating the barrier dysfunction . therefore , \\n following specific treatment to halt the acute pathological process , preventing recurrence with a proper skin care regimen is indicated . in eczema and atopic dermatitis , the careful clinician may resort to short - term ( 2-week ) use of corticosteroids to stop the inflammatory process . \\n calcineurin inhibitors are alternatively indicated for delicate areas on the face . in an effort to control histamine release in atopic dermatitis \\n , antihistamines can be added and a relatively allergen - free environment should be created . in rosacea , the mainstay of treatment is oral and topical antibiotics . in seborrhoeic dermatitis , azoles are the mainstay of treatment and low potency corticosteroids and emollients can be added acutely to treat the inflammatory process . \\n contact dermatitis ( cd ) and photocontact dermatitis ( pcd ) , as well as nonimmune contact urticaria ( nicu ) and immune contact urticaria ( icu ) , are all conditions that may elicit sss symptomology , with transient objective findings on physical exam . \\n allergen - free products are now available and should be included as part of further skin care regimen in these patients . \\n the main reason why nicu is often a missed diagnosis in patients presenting with the sss is the transient nature of the reaction . \\n thus , after testing with small amounts of product on the skin , the patient should be carefully examined using minimal magnification : the lesions will be typically revealed within 20 minutes . \\n common trigger agents are fragrances ( e.g. cinnamic aldehyde ) and preservatives such as sorbic and benzoic acids . once triggers \\n icu can be demonstrated with open and occluded testing , followed by prick testing with appropriate positive and negative controls if no response is elicited . \\n various foods , latex , parabens , and other chemicals have been implicated in the causation of icu . \\n however , there are cases in which no clinical clue is provided by the physical exam . in these cases , a 2-week trial of appropriate - strength corticosteroid may solve the mystery by pointing to an eczematous process in the case of symptoms resolution . \\n nonetheless , the careful clinician should consider avoiding prolonged use of topical corticosteroids since there is anecdotal clinical experience of topical corticosteroids inducing sss and , at least in the case of barrier dysfunction , earlier and complete steroid tachyphylaxis has been demonstrated . \\n if no symptomatic relief is observed , the patient 's sss is likely due to an invisible underlying cause . \\n both of these cases defined by maibach , no signs are present or can be elicited on the skin . in objective irritation \\n the mechanism is unknown and this diagnosis likely bundles more than one pathological process in it . interestingly ( and clinically frustratingly ) , maibach considers subjective irritation to be the most common cause of cis . \\n finally , body dysmorphic disorder ( bdd ) should always be considered by the dermatologist when assessing skin complaints without objective findings . \\n a recent cross - sectional study found a prevalence of 14% among patients in a cosmetic dermatology clinic . in the context of sss \\n , dermatologists should be aware that facial irritation complaints without any findings on exam are a common presentation in the dysmorphic patients and therefore extra caution is warranted . \\n referral to a mental health professional is indicated since these patients are at risk of suicidal behavior . \\n maibach notes that patients suspected of having bdd often require a detailed diagnostic process in order to build the trust needed to safely refer them to the mental health professional . table 2 summarizes the steps in the evaluation of a patient suspected to have sss . \\n specific algorithms have been developed for the management of sss but they are the result of accumulated clinical experience and lack experimental evidence to support their use . nonetheless , algorithmic thinking may aid in ensuring complete assessment . \\n these algorithms include four basic steps : discontinuation , assessment , testing , and slow re - introduction . \\n discontinuation of all topical medication and/or products , as well as elimination of activities and clothing resulting in skin friction , should be initiated and may need to last up to 12 months . the patient should then be assessed ( as described above ) for the occurrence of any visible dermatoses . if no clear pathology has emerged , rigorous testing is the next step . \\n testing should include patch and photopatch testing of routine allergens as well as of all of the patient 's skin care items . \\n specific testing for contact urticaria should be a part of the testing protocol . finally , \\n the next step in management is slow re - introduction of the  minimally necessary skin care products . for females , \\n recommend adding low - allergenic- potential cosmetic products one at a time in the following order : lipstick , face powder , and blush . \\n for all products re- introduced , recommend testing by applying the product to a 2-cm area lateral to the eye for five consecutive nights and documenting the positive and/or negative result . \\n this exhausting process is not only a rational solution from a clinical management standpoint but may also aid in diagnosing the specific culprit in cases of invisible sss . \\n understanding the underlying mechanisms may lead to the development of a well - standardized screening test . \\n this will allow clinical studies to rely on objective findings rather than self - reports and this , in turn , may result in more comprehensive and efficient management strategies . \\n female self - perception of sensitivity is consistently increased compared to that of males , yet when put through objective reactivity testing the trend is unclear . \\n it is reasonable to organize the differential diagnosis by dividing sss into visible and invisible sss .\", \"spontaneous pneumothorax ( sp ) comprises the largest group and is classified into primary spontaneous ( psp ) and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax . \\n psp usually occurs in young , tall , thin men , especially smokers , in the absence of an underlying lung disease . \\n although , sp is a relatively common condition , bilateral primary spontaneous pneumothorax ( bpsp ) is a very rare clinical condition with an occurrence ranging from 1.3 to 1.9% of all cases of sp . \\n herein , we present a case of bpsp in an overweight young male patient , which is an exceptionally rare event . \\n an otherwise - healthy , non - smoker , 20-year - old , overweight ( bmi 29.8 kg / m ) greek male patient was presented to the emergency department complaining of low - intensity chest pain and breathlessness of progressive worsening over the preceding 7 days . on admission , \\n blood pressure was 125/70 mmhg , heart rate 100 beats / min , sao2 97% on air and axillary temperature 36.8c . \\n initial plain chest x - ray demonstrated bilateral pneumothoraces ( more prominent on the left side ) and no deviation of the trachea ( fig .  1 ) . \\n plain chest x - rays on admission revealing bilateral pneumothorax . on emergency basis , the patient was managed with bilateral tube thoracostomy through the fifth intercostal spaces . during hospitalization \\n , both lungs were gradually expanded ; the use of continuous aspiration was necessary for a couple of days , in order to achieve complete expansion of the left lung ( fig .  2 ) . \\n next day the plain x - ray revealed recurrence of pneumothorax on the left side ( fig . \\n the tube was removed after 5 days ; no recurrence took place at this time . during the next 3 days the patient remained under observation ; serial physical examinations and chest x - rays were normal and the patient was discharged home . \\n recurrence of pneumothorax on the left side after removing the chest tube . during hospitalization a chest computed tomography ( ct ) was performed and revealed the presence of blebs at the apices of both upper lungs ( fig . \\n the patient was referred to a tertiary center for an elective video - assisted thoracoscopic surgery intervention ( vats ) . \\n three years after , no recurrence of pneumothorax took place and the patient remains healthy . \\n psp usually occurs in the absence of any obvious underlying lung disease ; however , blebs and bullae apparently play a role in the pathogenesis of psp , as they are found on ct or during thoracoscopy or thoracotomy in 4879% of these patients . \\n diagnosis of bilateral pneumothorax presents difficulties ; while unilateral pneumothorax is relatively easily suspected from the patient 's medical history , physical and radiological findings , the diagnosis of bilateral pneumothorax is usually delayed . \\n the presence of equally diminished breath sounds in both sides and the presence of a not deviated trachea often mislead clinicians and delay chest drain insertion which is usually performed after the transaction of chest ct . although sp is a relatively common condition , bpsp is a very rare clinical condition . \\n lee et al . , in their study of the 616 patients with 807 episodes of psp , found that the incidence of bpsp was 1.6% ( 13 patients ) . in univariate regression analysis \\n , patients with psp compared with patients with bpsp had significantly lower body weight , bmi , higher body height / body weight ratio and higher incidence of bilateral blebs / bullae seen in hrct of the lung . \\n however , in multiple regression analysis , only bmi and the presence of bilateral blebs / bullae retained statistically significant importance . \\n huang et al . found that only lower bmi and smoking were significantly associated with the formation of bpsp . in their study , the proportion of bilateral blebs / bullae seen in hrct was higher in the bpsp group than that in the psp group ( 63 vs 53% , respectively ) , but the difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.724 ) . \\n the present report describes a case of bpsp in an overweight patient showing that psp is an existing condition in patients with bmi value higher than the normal . \\n generally , if an sp affects < 20% of one lung , observation is efficient ; the absorption rate of the air is 1.25% ( 5075 ml / day ) . \\n if pneumothorax affects > 20% of the lung or if it increases during observation , chest tube drainage may be required . \\n air leakage can be diminished in 5 h and in 48 h in 52 and 82% of patients with tube thoracostomies , respectively . in patients with bpsp , one side \\n should always be drained regardless of the extent of pneumothorax , whereas the other side can be managed by simple observation depending on the extent of the air in the pleura space . \\n prolonged air leakage is the most common indication for operation in the first episode of pneumothorax . today \\n compared with open thoracotomy , this procedure provides visualization of the entire thoracic cavity by video and causes less postoperative pain . \\n single - stage bilateral vats procedure for bpsp has been advocated as an elective procedure to avoid subsequent anesthetic and operative procedures and longer hospital stays . \\n if any underlying pulmonary disease is detected during surgical treatment , the existence of pleural communications should be investigated and mediastinal pleura should be examined carefully . \\n in addition , apical pleurodesis further reduces the risk of recurrence . in our case , \\n the patient was successfully managed initially with a bilateral tube thoracostomy and finally with an elective bilateral vats procedure . in conclusion , bpsp is a rare clinical condition and usually develops in patients with low bmi and bilateral blebs / bullae . \\n bpsp in overweight - obese patients is an existing condition and its early diagnosis requires high suspicion index . \\n bpsp needs urgent assessment and management , followed by bilateral single - stage vats treatment as a safe and effective procedure . \\n \", \"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) is a progressive lung disease which is characterized by airway obstruction and lung parenchyma destruction . \\n patients may experience dyspnoea or shortness of breath , a persistent cough with sputum production , decreased exercise tolerance and decreased quality of life [ 1 , 2 ] . globally , copd is the fourth most common cause of death and is predicted by the world health organisation to be a major health concern in the coming decade . in australia , \\n 1.2 million people are estimated to have moderate - to - severe copd ( gold stages ii \\n iv ) . however , the true number is potentially much higher as copd is commonly underdiagnosed [ 4 , 5 ] . \\n the total cost of living with copd ( including nonmonetary costs ) is estimated to be $ 83  000 aud per person each year [ 6 , 7 ] . \\n as the severity of copd greatly impacts the cost of care , providing early diagnosis and effective management of the individual is an essential component in reducing its economic impact [ 5 , 810 ] . \\n pr is a multidisciplinary approach which incorporates self - management education with exercise training , psychosocial and nutritional support [ 11 , 12 ] . \\n it is a fundamental part of managing people with copd and has been shown to be effective in improving exercise tolerance , reducing dyspnoea , improving , quality of life and reducing the severity of acute exacerbations [ 1 , 1117 ] . \\n although pr has been shown to be effective in managing symptoms and reducing hospital admissions , poor participation and adherence are a current problem among outpatient programs . \\n factors include difficulty travelling to the program 's location [ 1922 ] , inconvenience of hospital attendance , or difficulty accessing programs . \\n australia is one of the least densely populated nations ( 2.7 people per square kilometre ) with up to 11.8% of the population residing in outer regional or remote locations . \\n conducted a study in kyabram ( rural victoria ) to assess the efficacy of their pr program and noted that patients who lived outside the town centre were more likely to withdraw from pr as the program was conducted within the town hospital . \\n this finding is also supported by de angelis and colleagues   who found that transport , travel distance , and related costs were the main reason for nonattendance of a cardiac rehabilitation program . \\n difficulty in accessing outpatient programs has led to the development of home - based programs . \\n it is well established that home - based pr programs are safe and effective [ 13 , 2931 ] and are recommended by many international guidelines and reviews [ 2 , 11 , 12 , 17 ] . given the effectiveness of independent home - based pr programs one could ask what additional benefits supervised remote - based programs would provide . \\n the main advantage of supervised remote - based programs is the ability to minimise anxiety in both patient and therapist . \\n this benefit has been shown in remote - based cardiac exercise programs where the use of transtelephonic exercise monitoring ( tem ) has been used to relieve patients ' and trainers ' anxiety during exercise [ 3234 ] . \\n it is anticipated that a person with copd could exercise to a higher intensity without the risk of undetected adverse events ( e.g. , exercise - induced oxygen desaturation ) . \\n telerehabilitation is an emerging technology used to facilitate the delivery of rehabilitation services at a distance by combining telecommunication and electronic transmission of health information . \\n it has the potential to provide equitable access for people living in rural or remote areas where access to health service is limited . \\n for telerehabilitation to be successful , however , there must be accurate assessment and outcome measurement tools available to therapists [ 37 , 38 ] . in pr , \\n the pulse oximeter is a noninvasive device which continuously monitors a person 's peripheral blood oxygen saturation ( spo2 ) and heart rate ( hr ) . \\n it is used clinically to measure a person 's exercise intensity and warn of exercise - induced desaturation . \\n the concept of remote monitoring of physiological data including spo2 and hr for exercise rehabilitation purposes has received attention in the literature . \\n as early as the mid-1980s , physicians were successful at remotely monitoring a patient 's electrocardiogram ( ecg ) through the analogue telephone network during a home - exercise program [ 40 , 41 ] . \\n however , the majority of electronic healthcare literature on pr has focused on telemonitoring systems [ 4246 ] or consultations services [ 36 , 47 ] . \\n there has been little research using e - health to deliver real - time , live supervision of patients for treatment purposes . \\n this study aimed to develop and verify the use of a remote pulse oximetry system on healthy individuals . specifically , it aimed to establish the technical feasibility of transmitting pulse oximetry data remotely , to determine the validity of remote measurements when compared to conventional face to face measurements , and to evaluate the participants ' perception on the usability of the technology . \\n it was hypothesised that remote pulse oximetry would not only be technically feasible but would also be valid when compared to conventional units and would be easy for participants to use . \\n a favourable result will enable the development of remote pulmonary rehabilitation programs for people living in rural or remote areas . \\n this study was reviewed and granted ethical clearance from the appropriate medical research ethics committee at the university of queensland . \\n thirty - seven healthy individuals were recruited to participate in a single remote cardiopulmonary exercise session . \\n the following exclusion criteria were applied : cardiovascular , respiratory , metabolic , or orthopaedic conditions that would prevent participation in an exercise program , chronic infectious diseases , pregnancy , and mental or physical impairment . \\n the exercise session was conducted using the ehab telerehabilitation system ( v2.0 , uniquest , brisbane , australia ) which is a computer - based videoconferencing and remote consultation system . \\n two ehab devices were used , one with the participant and the other with the therapist . \\n the participant and therapist were located in separate rooms . the ehab device with the participant \\n was configured to receive data from a bluetooth pulse oximeter module ( onyx ii 9560 , nonin medical inc . , plymouth , mn ) ( figure 1 ) . \\n this information was transmitted by the participant device at a frequency of one hertz via an encrypted data channel to an offsite server via an active server page ( asp ) web service . \\n the data was subsequently stored in a mysql database on the server . a therapist device retrieved this data via an asp web service to produce a graph of the participant 's heart rate and spo2 recordings in near real time . for this study \\n the ehab telerehabilitation system utilised a local wi - fi network connection ; however , the connection speed was throttled to 128  kbit / s to ensure compatibility with the 3g / hsdpa mobile network available in remote areas of australia . \\n after written consent was obtained , participants were taken to a room with the ehab device , remote pulse oximeter module , headset , and treadmill . \\n they were asked to remove any nail polish from their index finger on the nondominant hand or jewellery which may disrupt accurate recordings . \\n participants were given an information sheet with instructions on how to affix the pulse oximeter module to the index finger of their nondominant hand and how to establish a connection with a therapist in another room via the ehab device . \\n once a videoconference was established , the therapist guided the participant through an exercise session . \\n the modified borg score ( mbs )   was used to assess the participant 's exercise intensity . as per current copd exercise protocols \\n the session began with a warm - up phase ( mbs 2/10 ) for 5 minutes before gradually progressing to a moderate / somewhat severe intensity ( mbs 4 - 5/10 ) . \\n the last 5 minutes consisted of a cool - down phase ( mbs 2/10 ) . if any adverse signs were observed , the exercise session would be ceased immediately . \\n interrupted sessions due to technical difficulties were noted , and those participants were asked to repeat the exercise session at a later date .   at the conclusion of the exercise session \\n , participants completed a questionnaire about their experience with the remote pulse oximeter module and ehab device by marking on a 100  mm visual analogue scale ( vas ) and providing any open - ended comments .   during each session , \\n the participant ehab device logged heart rate ( hr ) and spo2 values from the pulse oximeter and time stamped the data . \\n this data was saved into a database stored locally on the computer ( dataset # 1 ) . \\n the participant device also transmitted the data to the remote therapist device where another time stamp was applied to enable the calculation of transmission latency . \\n this data was saved into a database stored locally on the therapist device ( dataset # 2 ) . \\n the mean data transmission rate was determined by measuring the bandwidth requirement ( kbit / s ) . \\n the satisfaction questionnaire rated the comfort , quality , and usability of the ehab device and remote pulse oximetry module . \\n the validity of remote pulse oximetry was assessed by comparing the remote measurements ( therapist data ) with conventional face - to - face measurements ( participant data ) . \\n these were percentage agreement , mean absolute difference ( mad ) , and the bland and altman 's limits of agreement method [ 49 , 50 ] . \\n percentage agreement was calculated as the proportion of data successfully transferred between participant and therapist . \\n the limits of agreement method enabled the quantification of the agreement between the two data sets in terms of the clinical significance of the transmission error . \\n specifically , it gave the upper and lower bounds which show the 95% confidence interval for the difference between the remote and conventional measurements ( i.e. , mean  1.96  sd ) . \\n when applying the limits of agreement method comparing the two datasets , the average of 10 second intervals of data was used .   in terms of clinical significance , the minimum clinically important difference ( mcid ) was used as a threshold value to represent meaningful and worthwhile change . \\n remote measurements were classified as valid if the measurement error was lower than the mcid . \\n the mcid for hr , however , varies depending on the individual 's exercise tolerance . for the purpose of this study , \\n the manufacturer 's device accuracy of 3 beats per minute ( bpm ) was used as the mcid , which was a conservative estimate . \\n data was analysed using statistical package for the social sciences ( v17.0 spss inc . , chicago , il ) . a p value of < 0.05 was considered to be significant , where applicable . \\n thirty - seven healthy individuals ( 14 males and 23 females ) completed a total of 15 exercise hours . \\n participants had a mean age of 30 years and standard deviation of 15 years ( range : 18 to 62 ) . \\n there were 34 successfully completed sessions on first attempt confirming the feasibility of the method , while three had to be repeated due to technical difficulties with the bluetooth or wifi connection . \\n the mean ( sd ) transmission latency of the pulse oximetry data ( not the videoconference ) between the computers was 2.94 ( 0.59 ) seconds . \\n the mean ( sd ) bandwidth usage for data transmitted was 6.5 ( 1.0 ) kbit / s . \\n of the remaining data , 9.0% was found to be omitted from the therapist device , while 11% was found to consist of duplicated numbers . \\n the mad and limits of agreement between participant and therapist data are shown in table 1 . \\n overall , participants rated their experience with the remote pulse oximeter and ehab device highly . \\n the mean response to each of the eight questionnaire items is shown in figure 2 . \\n positive written comments included the following :  i would be comfortable using [ this device ] at home \\n ( n = 4 ) and  [ the ehab was ] simple and easy to use \\n negative comments included worried [ remote pulse oximeter ] could dislodge during vigorous exercise ( n = 5 ) , remote pulse oximeter was uncomfortable ( n = 4 ) , and audio or video quality was  jumpy  ( n = 3 ) . \\n however , inconvenience , distance , or availability of pr programs can lead to lack of participation and poor compliance . \\n this study demonstrated the feasibility of a remote pulse oximeter for use during a pr program . \\n remote measurements of spo2 and hr were valid when compared to conventional face - to - face measurements . \\n these findings provide confidence for the development of a remote pr program .   in our study \\n , there was an unexpectedly high mean rate of data omission ( 9.0% ) and duplication ( 11% ) between participant and therapist data . \\n although these error rates appear comparatively high , they do not necessarily indicate a failure in the data transmission . \\n rather , the logging of data points by the participant device appears to not be perfectly synchronized with data retrieval from the therapist device . \\n this may be a function of the variable delays that can be present with web service calls which were used in this study to transmit data . \\n asynchrony in web service responses may have resulted in either repetition of data or omission of single values . moreover \\n , a visual inspection of the data confirms a random distribution of error throughout the data file . despite this asynchrony , \\n the mad analysis revealed a small difference ( spo2 0.04% ; hr 0.21  bpm ) in comparison to the mcid of 4% for spo2 and 3  bpm for hr . \\n similarly , the limits of agreement demonstrated a small difference in comparison to the mcid for spo2 and hr . \\n the upper and lower bounds for spo2 were 0.67 to 0.67% and for hr were 2.90 to 2.89  bpm . \\n both are within the mcid , and this provides further evidence for the validity of remote measurements . unlike mad , which analyses the actual difference , the limits of agreement give a conservative estimation of difference through a 95% confidence interval . \\n clinically , it means 95% of the time of the difference due to measurement error will be within the relevant limits for spo2 and hr . \\n the mad and limits of agreement values show that remote measurements are sufficiently accurate and valid for real - time monitoring purposes . \\n overall , as indicated by questionnaire responses , participants found the remote pulse oximeter easy to use ( mean vas 89/100 ) and felt confident that they would be able to use it at home ( mean vas 87/100 ) . \\n this is similar to literature which has found the ehab device user friendly [ 5557 ] . \\n however , some participants ( n = 4 ) stated that the remote pulse oximeter was uncomfortable . unlike a conventional pulse oximeter , the remote module has the sensor , display and battery unit all incorporated on the fingertip ( see figure 1 ) . \\n this creates additional weight compared to a conventional sensor , and it could be a contributing factor to the feeling of instability experience by these participants . \\n future studies should compare the comfort with other remote pulse oximeters that have the display and battery unit located at the wrist . \\n furthermore , this needs to be investigated in the copd population as they may be more accustomed to pulse oximetry than healthy adults . \\n five participants commented that they were worried the remote pulse oximeter could dislodge during vigorous exercise . \\n this could be a result of the weight of the device and high intensity of exercise , where most participants needed to jog or run in order to reach an mbs of 5/10 . \\n problems with video and audio quality have been identified as key issues in telehealth [ 5860 ] . during testing \\n , there were occasional disruptions in audio and video transmissions during the exercise session , and on three occasions , the videoconference unexpectedly exited due to connectivity issues on the wifi network , requiring the call to be reestablished . \\n the low frame rate is likely due to the low bandwidth available ( 128  kbit / s ) on the network connection . \\n however , it should be noted that the remote pulse oximeter only uses a very small bandwidth ( 6.5  kbit / s ) for data transmission and , therefore , is unlikely to have attributed to the reduced video / audio quality . \\n there were several limitations of this study ( 1 ) our sample size was small ( n = 37 ) and consisted primarily of young , healthy university students ( mean age 30 years ) . \\n our healthy participants did not show any clinical changes ( e.g. , exercise - induced desaturation ) , and this may have affected the magnitude of error in mad and limits of agreement . \\n furthermore , the young population may be more confident to use or learn about new technology , and this may have therefore influenced the result of the satisfaction questionnaire . \\n ( 2 ) this study was conducted within the university clinic . although the participant and therapist were in separate rooms , they were in close proximity to each other , with the therapist on call if any difficulties occurred . \\n whist the ehab system was bandwidth throttled to ensure compatibility with the 3g / hsdpa mobile network , other factors such as mobile network coverage , signal strength , and speed were not assessed , and this may have affected the performance and the latency of transmission . \\n future studies should include a trial of the remote pulse oximetry system in the home environment with a copd population on the 3g / hsdpa mobile telephone network . \\n a large sample size is required to more rigorously assess the validity and reliability of data transmissions . \\n furthermore , it has been shown that patients demonstrate more positive views of telecare encounters than their healthcare providers . \\n a therapist questionnaire is therefore required to assess their satisfaction and confidence in safely conducting a remote exercise session . \\n our pilot study demonstrated that remote pulse oximetry was feasible , and the data transmission method produced valid data at the remote end when compared with conventional face - to - face measures . \\n although this study was performed on healthy individuals , participants found the ehab device easy to operate and were confident it could be used at home . \\n further studies are needed to address the technical feasibility and validity in a home environment and the therapist 's confidence in conducting a safe exercise program .\", \"acute mountain sickness ( ams ) occurs during exposure to high altitude ( ha ) and is a clinical syndrome characterised by headache , insomnia , malaise , and gastrointestinal symptoms . \\n it is common , developing in 1030% at 25003000 meters   and in up to 60% of those ascending to around 4500 meters . \\n it causes significant morbidity and is a challenging clinical condition in remote environments . a biochemical marker of ams , particularly one available as a point - of - care test ( poc ) , could have widespread clinical utility . \\n the pathophysiology of ams is not clearly understood but involves alterations in fluid balance , endothelial function , vascular permeability , inflammation , and oxidative stress . \\n the renal response to ha is an important factor in acclimatization , and ha exposure leads to renal arteriole constriction and relative hypoxia [ 3 , 4 ] . despite the relative renal hypoxia , \\n ngal ( neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin ) is a 25  kda peptide , part of the lipocalin family of small soluble proteins . \\n it is produced in a number of human tissues , notably the distal nephron but also in the lung   ngal rises rapidly in the nephron in response to a renal insult and an ngal 150  ng / ml following acute kidney injury ( aki ) is predictive of acute renal failure ( arf ) well before creatinine has risen . \\n ngal is also an acute - phase protein , has a role in inflammation [ 8 , 9 ] , and is upregulated in the lung during inflammation [ 5 , 10 , 11 ] . \\n ngal is also known to rise in conditions associated with oxidative stress [ 12 , 13 ] , and oxidative stress has been implicated in ams [ 14 , 15 ] . \\n we therefore hypothesised that ngal would increase at ha secondary to these various stimuli and that the magnitude of any increase might relate to the presence of ams . \\n we therefore studied a combined cohort of trekkers from 2 expeditions to ha . in order to clarify the relative contribution of ams , hypoxia or exercise to ngal levels \\n , we also studied a cohort pre- and postexercise at near sea level , and a further cohort exposed to acute normobaric hypoxia . \\n the potential role of inflammation in stimulating ngal was assessed by the measurement of highly sensitive c - reactive protein ( hscrp ) in a subset of participants . \\n all study protocols were approved by the ministry of defence research ethics committee , whitehall , uk , and satisfied the requirements of the declaration of helsinki . in all studies informed , \\n thirty - two subjects participating in a defence medical services ( dms ) trekking expedition ( trek 1 ) in the khumbu region of nepal were studied . \\n blood samples were taken from the antecubital fossa at 3 study altitudes : on day 2 at 3400  m , day 6 at 4270  m , and day 10 at 5150  m ( following ascent to everest base camp at 5364  m ) . all samples in this study \\n were collected immediately following a day trekking (  posttrek  ) to the study altitude . \\n twenty subjects from a further dms expedition ( trek 2 ) to nepal were also studied . \\n blood samples were again taken at 3 study altitudes : on day 2 ( 3400  m ) , day 6 ( 4270  m ) , and day 10 ( 5150  m ) ( following ascent to kala patthar ( kp ) , 5643  m ) . \\n samples in this study were again collected immediately following a day trekking (  posttrek  ) . \\n additional samples were taken at rest in kathmandu ( kat ) at 1300  m and at rest the next morning at the 3 study altitudes . \\n as serving members of the military , all subjects were able to fulfil the fitness criteria of their relevant service . \\n this broadly includes an age - adjusted ability to run 1.5 miles in under approximately 11 minutes and to perform an age - adjusted number of sits - ups and push - ups within two blocks of 2 minutes . \\n fourteen subjects underwent a 3-hour exposure to normobaric hypoxia ( fio2 11.6% , equivalent to 4800  m altitude ) in a hypoxic chamber . \\n this exposure included a 5-minute step test ( step height of 25  cm , 1 complete step every 2 seconds ) at 95 minutes . \\n a group of 22 subjects had ngal assayed at rest and after exercise at sl in the uk following ascent from sea level to 1085  m over 6 hours ( an equivalent gain in altitude and duration of exercise similar to that experienced on a trekking day in nepal ) . \\n two subjects from trek 2 were part of the sl exercise group , but data collection occurred several months apart . \\n ngal was analysed in the field on a biosite triage point of care monitor ( alere ltd , stockport , uk ) using a triage ngal test kit . \\n the triage ngal test is a point - of - care , fluorescence - based immunoassay used which gives a rapid ( 15 minutes ) quantitative measurement of ngal in a range from 60 to 1,300  ng / ml . \\n oxygen saturation ( digitally on warm hands at rest ) was measured using a nellcor np-20 pulse oximeter ( covidian , ma , usa ) during trek 1 + 2 and in the hypoxic chamber study at the same time as blood samples were taken . during trek 1 + 2 , \\n twice - daily ams scores were assessed using the lake louise score ( lls ) questionnaire . \\n the lls allocates a score of 0 to 3 ( symptom not present to severe ) for symptoms of ams ( headache , gastrointestinal symptoms , fatigue / weakness , dizzy / light - headedness , and difficulty sleeping ) . \\n a score of 3 or more in the presence of headache is consistent with ams , a score of 6 or more with severe ams . \\n the commercially available , highly sensitive , immunoturbidimetric assay ( roche diagnostics ) was used to measure crp in trek 2 at the same time points as ngal . \\n mg / l and a between - run coefficient of variation between 2.5 and 5.7% . for statistical calculations , \\n the software package spss 14.0 was used . for subjects with a ngal below the limit of detection of the assay ( 60  ng / ml ) , \\n a value of 60  ng / ml was assigned for the purposes of statistical analysis . \\n all data were tested for gaussian distribution using the kolmogorov - smirnov test and shapiro wilks statistic .   for the analysis of dependent variables that were normally distributed , changes were tested by student 's paired t - test . for independent variables that were normally distributed , \\n a within - subjects anova was performed to investigate any serial changes in ngal with ascent at rest and post - trek . a two - way mixed anova with either resting or after trek ngal at each study altitude as the within - subjects factor and the presence of ams ( according to the ll score at multiple altitudes ) as the between - subjects factor \\n if the mauchly sphericity test was significant , then p values were expressed after multiplication by the greenhouse - geisser epsilon . \\n correlation analyses for normally distributed data were performed by calculating the pearson coefficient of correlation . \\n a p value < 0.05 ( two - sided ) was considered significant . as the ascent profile and route were closely matched in trek 1 and trek 2 , data were combined and analysed as a whole . taking medication ( acetazolamide , dexamethasone ) \\n had no apparent effect on ngal values , and therefore these subjects ( n = 11 ) were not excluded from the analysis . \\n demographic data for the field study ( trek 1 + 2 ) , the controls , and the hypoxic chamber study are shown in table 1 . in the 22 subjects ascending to 1085  m in the uk \\n , there was no significant ( p = 0.084 ) rise in ngal following exercise : resting sl ngal was 64  11 ( ng / ml , mean  sd , range 60104 ) and postexercise ngal was 71  14 ( ng / ml , mean  sd , range 60100 ) . of the 52 subjects , \\n spo2 ( % , mean  sem ) dropped from 97  2 at kat ( 1300  m ) to 84  5 and 79  7 at 4270 and 5150  m , respectively ( p < 0.001 ) . \\n there was a moderate inverse correlation between ngal and spo2 at 5150  m ( r = 0.477 , p = 0.001 ) ( figure 1 ) with a weaker inverse correlation between ngal and spo2 at 4270  m ( r = 0.340 , p = 0.019 ) . \\n within the subjects , anova demonstrated a significant change in ngal with ascent both at rest ( p = 0.007 ) and after trek ( p = 0.001 ) ( figure 2 ) . \\n spo2 ( % , mean  sem ) dropped from 99  0.4 at baseline to a nadir of 79  5 ( p < 0.001 ) . despite an equivalent drop in spo2 to \\n that seen in trek 1 + 2 , ngal ( ng / ml , mean  sd , range ) showed no change between baseline and 180 minutes : 63  26 ( 2980 ) versus 67  25 ( 2784 ) , p = 0.538 . in trek 2 , serum creatinine { mol / l , mean  sem , ( range ) , ( p value versus baseline at kat ) } was 78  2 ( 6395 ) at baseline ; at 3400 , 4270 and 5150  m it was 87  3 ( 72120 ) ( p = 0.001 ) ; 84  2 ( 72104 ) ( p < 0.001 ) ; and 94  5 ( 76142 ) ( p < 0.001 ) . \\n according to their ll scores at the highest study altitude ( 5150  m ) , there were 23 subjects with no ams , 16 subjects with mild ams , and 7 subjects with severe ams . \\n there was a significant difference between ngal depending on the presence or absence of ams at 5150  m ( figure 3 ) with higher values in those with ams and severe ams . a two - way mixed anova revealed a significant change ( p = 0.003 ) in resting ngal with ascent and an interaction with ams at 4270  m ( p = 0.017 ) and 4910  m ( p = 0.002 for change in ngal , p = 0.027 for interaction with ams ) . \\n hscrp was ( mean  sem , range ) : 1.6  0.4 ( 0.337.53 ) at baseline ; at 3400  m , 4270  m , and 5150  m post - trek : 7  2.9 ( 0.7847.93 ) ( p = 0.002 versus baseline ) ; 25.7  8.1 ( 0.58104 ) ( p < 0.001 versus baseline ) ; 9  3.2 ( 0.5644.62 ) ( p = 0.003 versus baseline ) . at 3400  m , 4270  m , and 5150  m at rest : 6.2  2.9 ( 1.8725.1 ) ( p = 0.001 versus baseline ) ; 21.6  5.7 ( 0.4983.9 ) ( p < 0.001 versus baseline ) ; and 5.8  2.1 ( 0.5426.59 ) ( p = 0.012 versus baseline ) . \\n ngal at 5150  m , after trek was moderately correlated with hscrp at 5100  m after exercise ( rho 0.526 , p = 0.036 ) . \\n this is the first report to describe an association between ngal and both the presence and severity of ams at ha . \\n the significant novel findings are that ngal rises in response to sustained hypobaric hypoxia but not acute normobaric hypoxia or near sl exercise and that this rise is related to ams at 5150  m.   the rise in ngal following trekking ( by day 2 at 3400  m ) was to the levels normally associated with the subsequent development of arf ( > 150  ng / ml ) , but this did not occur . \\n although creatinine rose significantly with altitude , the rise was very modest , and we suspect that a combination of factors other than a simple renal insult is responsible for the increase in ngal at ha . \\n our data suggest an inverse correlation between spo2 and ngal at 5150  m ( and to a lesser extent at 4270  m ) . although no such correlation was found at 3400  m , this may still suggest that prolonged renal hypoxia could be a significant drive to ngal release . \\n in addition to renal hypoxia , we suspect that other factors may also contribute to the rise in ngal at ha .   the significantly greater ngal in those with severe or mild ams versus those without at 5150 \\n indeed , ngal is an acute - phase protein   with a role in inflammation [ 8 , 10 , 11 ] . \\n exercise stimulates an immune response , and hypoxia is also known to cause a response in immune and endothelial cells with inflammatory markers such as hscrp increasing with ha [ 1922 ] . \\n consistent with this , we saw a significantly higher hscrp at all altitudes compared to baseline . \\n limited data have suggested hscrp may be associated with ams   but we did not demonstrate any evidence to support this . \\n there was a weak correlation between hscrp and ngal at 5150  m but this can not explain the rise in ngal as a whole . \\n ngal also rises with oxidative stress [ 9 , 12 ] which is increased by exercise , and ha - induced oxidative stress   has been implicated in ams . as such , it is interesting to note that we found a higher ngal following trekking and in those with ams at the highest altitude .   in an attempt to clarify the relative influence of exercise and hypoxia on ngal , we measured ngal before and after exercise of a similar duration ( 6  hrs ) and similar incremental altitude ( 1085  m ) as that experienced daily in nepal and also in a hypoxic chamber . in neither scenario did ngal rise . \\n this may reflect inadequate duration or severity of stimulus but may also reflect that the ngal response is not due to exercise or hypoxia alone but is multifactorial involving hypoxia , oxidative stress , an inflammatory response , and other , as yet unidentified , stimuli . \\n we also acknowledge limitations such as a lack of serum markers of oxidative stress and a lack of resting ngal data in trek 1 . \\n in addition , we did not measure ngal at sl before departure to nepal , although the ngal recorded as a baseline at kat ( 1300  m ) ( 68  ng / ml ) was no different to those recorded at sl in the uk ( 63 and 64  ng / ml ) . \\n we also acknowledge the fact that although we measured creatinine in trek 2 , we did not continue to monitor it after the cessation of trekking . as a consequence of creatinine rising more slowly in response to a renal insult than ngal , \\n in conclusion , there are several interesting and novel findings that are worthy of further exploration . \\n ngal rises in response to prolonged hypobaric hypoxia ; marked increases in ngal may occur without concomitant arf and the degree of ngal rise at ha is associated with the presence or absence of ams . \\n the fact that ngal does not appear to rise secondary to acute normobaric hypoxia or exercise in isolation suggests that the rise at ha and relation with ams may have common pathways , perhaps related to prolonged hypoxia and an inflammatory response . with the huge and increasing popularity of recreational sports undertaken at both moderate and high altitude \\n assessment of ngal takes a matter of minutes using poc testing , and its use in identifying ams requires further evaluation .\", 'a-38-year - old female patient consulted to our emergency outpatient clinic with complaints of fever , sore throat , coughing , shivering , chills , joint , and muscle pain , headache , chest pain continuing for nearly 2 weeks and she was hospitalized to investigate the etiology of fever . \\n physical examination findings were as follows : bp 130/80 mm hg , body temperature , 39.8 c ; hr 120/min ; moderately well general physical status with full cooperation , markedly hyperemic pharynx , and tonsils , herpetic rashes around her lips , bilaterally diminished respiratory sounds heard over basal segments and tachycardia . \\n her neck rigidity was evaluated however the kernig , and brudzinsky signs could not be elicited . \\n laboratory test results were as follows : hb 11 g / dl ( 12.117.2 ) , mcv 80.8 fl ( 82.299 )

hilar lymph nodes of which the largest being 2 cm in diameter , bilateral pleural effusion , and atelectasic areas in the parenchyma surrounding the pleural effusion were observed ( figure 1 , 2 ) . on abdominal tomograms , \\n no bacterial growth was detected in urine , throat , csf , and blood cultures . \\n lumbar punction performed because of suspect neck rigidity did not reveal any abnormal cells in csf . \\n cephtriaxone at daily parenteral doses of 2 g ) . during follow - up period , rashes , and swelling on her right , and \\n left wrists were detected , so she was consulted to rheumatology clinic , and naproxen sodium therapy was started with the indication of suspect aosd . on physical examination dullness over traube s space \\n however her hyperfebrile state persisted , echocardiograms obtained for the differential diagnosis of infective endocarditis . \\n posteroanterior chest radiogram costodiaphragmatic sinuses are not distinctly visualized , high - lying diaphragms , and an enlarged mediastinum were observed . biochemical analysis of the fluid drained by thoracenthesis of the patient whose computed tomograms demonstrated bilateral pleural effusion revealed the presence of 2 gm / dl albumin , 3.34 g / dl protein , 483 u / l ldh ( concurrent serum albumin 2.9 gm / dl , total protein 5.99 g / dl , ldh 393 u / l ) . \\n antibiotherapy of the patient with pleural effusion ( exudate ) was discontinued , and methylprednisolone treatment at daily doses of 16 mg was initiated . \\n after initiation of steroid therapy , she maintained an afebrile state , her joint manifestations regressed , and her complaints decreased during her follow - up period . \\n the patient whose pleural effusion completely regressed with steroid therapy discharged to be further followed up by rheumatology outpatient clinic ( figure 3 ) . \\n adult onset still s disease is a disease whose diagnosis can be made by excluding infectious , malign , autoimmune , and autoinflammatory diseases , and in consideration of its characteristic clinical , and laboratory findings . for definitive diagnosis , yamaguchi criteria can be used . \\n its major criteria consists of higher body temperature at 39c lasting for at least one week , marked nonpruritic macular / maculopapular salmon - colored rashes on the torso or extremities persisting for at least 2 weeks , leukocytosis ( > 10.000/ml ) , and neutrophilia ( > 80% ) . \\n minor criteria include sore throat , lymphadenopathy , hepatomegaly or splenomegaly , abnormal hepatic function tests ( increases in especially ast , alt , and ldh levels ) , and ana , and rf negativities . for the establishment of diagnosis , 5 diagnostic criteria ( including at least 2 major criteria ) should be met . in our patient , during approximately 4 weeks up to initiation of steroid therapy , fever exceeding 39c every day , symptoms of arthralgia , marked arthritis of both wrists , leukocytosis , neutrophilia , sore throat , and lymphadenopathies fulfilled the required diagnostic criteria , and pleural exudate seen during the clinical course of the disease was assessed to be associated with the disease . in the adult onset still \\n s disease pleural effusion , transient pulmonary infiltration , and pericarditis can be seen in 3040% of the patients . \\n affected individuals may complain of mild episodes of coughing , pleuritic chest pain , and shortness of breath . \\n even in some patients it may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) [ 6 , 7 ] . rarely , myocarditis , arrhytmias , heart failure , and cardiac tamponade can be seen . \\n myocarditis , and ards are more frequently seen especially in patients with mas . in the differential diagnosis , infectious diseases ( ebv , cmv , hbv , rubella , parvovirus , coxsackie , hiv , subacute bacterial endocarditis , meningococcemia , tuberculosis , syphilis ) ; vasculites ( takayasu arteritis , polyarteritis nodosa , serum disease , thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ) ; malign diseases ( leukemia , lymphoma ) , connective tissue diseases ( ra , sle , mixed connective tissue disease ) , granulomatous diseases ( sarcoidosis , crohn disease ) ; autoinflammatory diseases ( kikuchi disease , sweet syndrome ) , and drug hypersensitivity reactions should be considered . in our patient \\n serological tests , cultures , and imaging modalities were used for differential diagnosis which led to the establishment of the diagnosis of aosd . \\n higher ferritin levels are among the most important laboratory findings of aosd , however markedly lower glycosylated ferritin levels are detected ( < 20% ) . \\n increased ferritin level is an indicator of the disease activity , and also a serologic marker of treatment response . in our patient \\n ferritin levels may increase as a response of hepatocytes to cytokines as il-18 , and il-1b which may be thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of aosd . \\n as the first - line therapy nsaids ( especially endomethacin ) , and corticosteroids are recommended . in cases of severe organ involvement pulsatile high doses of steroids for few days can be used , than daily dose is dropped down to 1 mg / kg . in cases of recurrence or with the intention to decrease steroid dose , methotrexate at a weekly dose of 7.525 mg can be given . \\n hydroxychloroquine , sulphasalazine , azothioprine , cyclosporine can be used separately or in combination with methotrexate . in recent years , \\n effectiveness of biological agents ( infliximab , etanercept , anakinra , and tocilizumab ) , and ivig therapies have been reported in the treatment patients with serious organ involvement , and mas . \\n still many characteristic features of aosd are not known , and a standard follow - up or a treatment protocol of the disease is not available . in patients who met diagnostic criteria , pleural effusion which may be seen in the clinical course of the disease should be presumably associated with the disease . \\n besides regression of pleural effusion can be expected with the treatment of underlying desease , additional locally invasive diagnostic , and/or therapeutic interventions should be avoided .', 'dual - polymerizing resin cements have been extensively used for placement of indirect restorations and posts . \\n the dual - polymerizing materials were developed to compensate for the lack of polymerization in the absence of light and to represent a combination of auto- and light - polymerizing components . in some clinical situations , such as in dark zones at the apical region and during the cementation of indirect restorations , the severe light attenuation results in low degree of conversion ( dc ) , which can compromise the mechanical properties and consequently the longevity of the indirect restorations.14 modifications in the viscosity of the resin cements allow their use in different clinical situations . \\n the option for low viscosity versions offer some benefits , such as minor thickness of the pellicle that was formed following the restoration placement . \\n the lowest film thickness generates smaller polymerization shrinkage , reducing the possibility of gaps formation and premature marginal leakage.5,6 the difference in the cement formulations that change the viscosity is related to the proportion between resin matrix and filler particle content.7 high volume fraction of fillers can increase the viscosity and the elastic modulus and strength of composites.7,8 low viscosity or flowable resins and resin cements present lower filler loading than regular restorative materials . \\n most direct dental restorative composites use bisphenol - a - diglycidylether dimethacrylate ( bis - gma ) , which is considered a very viscous monomer , and when mixed with higher filler loadings , it becomes a nearly solid mass and unusable product . \\n vinyl groups ( e.g. , ethylene glycol dimethacrylate ) are added as a thinner or diluent monomer for uncured pastes , which are considered another approach to change the viscosity of resin - based materials . \\n the filler loading and the viscosity of composites may interfere in the monomer conversion , since they could restrict the mobility of monomers and the propagation of polymerization reaction.7,911 the restorative resin - based materials must reach a high degree of monomer conversion in order to present better clinical performance and longevity and also to reduce the early failures . for the dual - polymerizing resin cements \\n , the self - cure mode should ensure the high level of conversion , especially in the cervical proximal areas , the root canal and in the internal and deep areas of the cavity preparations.1214 several methodologies have been used to analyze the dc of resin - based materials ; however , most of them use fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ) . although many researchers have evaluated the polymerization effectiveness to determine the physical and mechanical properties of dental materials,9,15,16 little information is known about the influence of different viscosities of dual - cured resin cements on their physical properties , such as the degree of conversion in situations of self - and dual - polymerization . \\n thus , the purpose of this study was to measure the dc of two commercially dual - cured resin cements in different viscosities ( low and high ) when they were light - activated or when the materials were allowed to self - cure solely , after 5 minutes and 24 hours from the mixture of pastes ( base and catalyst ) . \\n the hypothesis tested was that curing mode , evaluation time and viscosity would affect the dc of the resin cements . \\n two commercial dual - cure resin cements in high and low viscosities were evaluated : variolink ii ( ivoclar vivadent , schaan , liechtenstein ) and nexus 2 ( kerr corp . , orange , ca , usa ) . \\n the resin cements consist of two paste components that were equally dispensed and mixed together according to manufacturers instructions . after mixing , resin cements ( n=5 ) \\n were applied to the horizontal attenuated total reflectance znse crystal at 45 ( fourier transform infrared spectrometer , ft - ir spectrometer 520 , nicolet instrument corp , madson , wi , usa ) at room temperature . \\n adhesive tape ( 3 m , sumar , sp , brazil ) was placed on the znse crystal surface to act as a spacer , ensuring standard thickness for all specimens ( 100120 mm ) . a mylar strip ( quimidrol com . \\n ltda , joinville , sc , brazil ) was placed over the cement and was pressed flat to spread the material on the crystal surface . \\n the spectrum of unpolymerized material was obtained and the cements were either light - cured ( dual - polymerizing mode ) or allowed to self - cure only ( autopolymerizing mode ) . \\n each specimen was left on the crystal surface and further spectra were obtained 5 minutes and 24 hours after post mixing . for light - cured groups , a halogen light curing unit ( xl 3000 , 3 m espe , st . \\n paul , mn , usa ) was used during 40 seconds (  600 mw / cm ) . \\n the light intensity was periodically checked with a radiometer ( curing radiometer , model 100 , kerr corp . , orange , ca , usa ) . \\n spectra were obtained between 4000 cm and 750 cm at a resolution of 4 cm . \\n monomer conversion was calculated ( % ) according to the changes in the ratio between the absorbance peaks corresponding to the aliphatic ( cc ) ( 1638 cm ) and aromatic ( 1608 cm ) carbon double bonds prior to and 5 minutes and 24 hours after polymerization initiation for both curing modes.10 the aromatic peak is used as an internal reference because the intensity does not change during the polymerization reaction.9,11 the effect of curing mode , viscosity and time intervals on the dc were evaluated for each material . \\n three - way repeated measure analysis of variance ( anova ) ( curing mode , viscosities and evaluation time ) was performed and tukey s post - hoc test was used to detect pair wise differences among experimental groups . \\n the data was analyzed using the statistical program sas 9.1 ( sas institute , cary , nc , usa ) and all statistical testing was performed at a pre - set alpha of 0.05 ( p<.05 ) . \\n the statistical analysis of the data showed significant differences in curing mode , viscosity and evaluation time factors for both resin cements ( p=.01 ) . \\n there was significant interaction between factors : the curing mode x evaluation time ( p=.01 ) . \\n other double - interactions and the triple - interaction ( curing mode x viscosity x evaluation time ) were not significant ( p>.05 ) . \\n the dc of resin cements was higher when the materials were light - cured and when the low - viscosity versions were used than when self - curing mode and the high - viscosity resin cements were tested , respectively ( p<.05 ) . \\n the results of this study showed that the curing mode ( auto- and dual - polymerization ) , the viscosity ( low or high ) and the evaluation time ( 5 minutes or 24 hours ) influenced the dc of resin cements . \\n thus , the research hypothesis stating that these factors would result in significant changes in the dc was accepted . as the dc is dependent on the monomeric composition and the concentration and type of the photoinitiator in each product,9,17 the statistical analysis comparing the dc between resin cements \\n the main factors under study ( curing mode , viscosities and time intervals ) produced similar effects for the resin cements , which presented different formulations regarding the resin matrix composition and type and concentration of filler particles . the variations on the proportion of components of resin matrix and filler particles that produced the low and the high versions caused no difference in behavior between the two cements results.7 a high monomer conversion with cross - linked polymeric network formation is essential for the durability of the resin - based restorations.911 studies have shown the importance of a high dc of resinous materials in order to reach better mechanical properties , since the presence of a high amount of residual methacrylate monomers compromises the hardness , the abrasion and the fracture resistance . moreover \\n , the low dc can increase the sorption and the solubility , interfering in the color stability and mass loss of the resin cement.2,4,9,14,1720 the resin cements showed significant difference between the evaluation times , 5 minutes and 24 hours from the polymerization initiation , independently of viscosity or curing mode . \\n thus , the polymerization reaction for both resin cements continued after 5 minutes of the mixing of the base and catalyst pastes . \\n the continuation of the chemical part of the polymerization reaction ( benzoyl peroxide + tertiary amines ) was primarily responsible for the increase of the dc after 24 hours . \\n additionally , the percentage of dc increasing after 24 hours was higher for the self - cure mode than the dual cure mode , which ranged from 38.3 to 42.4% and from 26.6 to 28.4% , respectively . the continuation reaction 24 hours after polymerization initiation resulted in a reduction of absorbance peaks that corresponded to the aliphatic carbon double bonds10 and \\n the dual polymerization increased dc , which corroborates with several studies that compared the polymerization modes for resin - based materials.2,11,21,22 for both resin cements used in this study , the direct light - polymerization provided dc that was higher and ranged from 10 to 30% higher than those observed for the self - curing mode . also , it was higher at 5 minutes ( 24 to 30% ) than for 24 hours ( 10 to 12% ) from the polymerization initiation \\n . the auto - polymerization may be insufficient to result in an adequate dc for the long lasting restorations . \\n clinically , the low viscosity version ensured higher dc , and 24 hours elapsed time after setting of restoration is appropriate for the final appointment , since the higher dc could better support the final oclusal adjustments , finishing , and polishing procedures . \\n the direct light - polymerization can be considered a limitation of this study , since the light is applied directly to the resin cement layer only at the periphery of restorations . \\n on the other hand , the inner part of indirect restorations is reached by an attenuated light and resin cement may depend only on self - cure activation . regarding the differences in the dc between high and low viscosities , higher mean values were found for low viscosity versions of both resin cements . \\n low viscosity materials can be due to lower filler loading and/or higher addition low viscosity diluents monomers . \\n the low viscosity monomer allows better mobility and distribution of free radicals inside the resin material , which can increase the polymerization reaction and the monomer conversion.9 the increase of dc promoted by the low viscosity versions in percentage , following the polymerization mode ranged from 0.9 to 3.1% for the dual - polymerizing groups and ranged from 1.5 to 3.9% for the auto - polymerizing mode , which was the highest percentage among the groups from nexus 2 resin cement . for the variolink ii \\n , dual - polymerizing groups ranged from 1.4 to 2.8% , while the auto - polymerizing mode ranged from 1.7 to 2.4% . \\n the direct light - activation and the low viscosity version were important to provide higher dc for the dual - polymerizing resin cements . \\n twenty - four hours after seating the indirect restoration is appropriate for final oclusal adjustments , finishing , and polishing procedures , which are capable of generating stress to the resin cement layer .', 'literature analysis showed few articles about this complication , but no publication has described the management of open patella fracture around total knee arthroplasty . \\n we report a unique case of an open patellar fracture above a total knee arthroplasty , sustained by a 56-year - old female patient . \\n despite the poor outcome of operative management in patellar periprosthetic fracture , this approach should be considered for acute and post traumatic fractures in young patients with a good remaining bone stock . \\n the demographic changes with a high rate of aging and active population , as well as the improved life expectancy during the last decades have led to an increase in the number of total knee arthroplasties ( tka ) [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] , and consequently a raise of post - operative complications . among these complications , \\n periprosthetic fracture after tka is the most frequent cause of post - operative pain , and revision surgery . \\n they may occur in the supracondylar region of the femur , followed by the patella , then the proximal tibia [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] . \\n this entity can be very challenging to manage , with unpredictable and poor outcome , especially for displaced fracture or in cases with implant loosening [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 8 ] . in this article \\n , we report a unique case of an open periprosthetic patellar fracture that was managed with operative treatment . \\n it also involves a literature analysis with description of the risk factors and treatment options of this uncommon entity . \\n a 56-year - old female underwent a cemented postero - stabilized condylar tka with fixed tibial plateau through an antero - medial approach , in our department . \\n she had severe osteo - arthritis of the left knee with a major stiffness ( irreducible flexum at 25 ) . \\n initial ( 1 ) and post operative(2 ) knee radiographs before , and after the arthroplasty . \\n three weeks later , the patient tripped and fell off with all her standing height striking the anterior aspect of the left knee with hyper flexion . \\n she was taken to the emergency room with left knee pain and a large skin wound . \\n physical examination showed a large , deep and longitudinal wound measuring 15 cm in length due to a total breakdown of the suture line ( the antero - medial approach performed during the tka ) ( fig . 3 , 4 ) . \\n fig 3 . a clinical picture showing the open patellar fracture a

knee radiograph showing the patellar fracture above a total knee arthroplasty , without any signs ofimplants loosening . \\n the knee radiographs showed a short oblique fracture at the inferior pole of the patella without any loosening of the implants or dislocation of the knee : this fracture is classified as type i according to ortigueraet d.j . \\n she urgently received intravenous antibiotic ( augmentin , gentamicin ) , as well as tetanus vaccination . \\n her fracture was temporarily stabilized in a long - leg plaster splint before she was transported to the operating room . \\n she underwent wound irrigation , debridement of non - viable soft tissue from the wound , open reduction and fixation with a figure - eight cerclage wiring , without any revision of the implants . \\n the wound was closed without any skin tension , after placing an intra - articular drain . \\n complementary immobilization with a removable knee pad at full extension , for six weeks was prescribed . \\n post operative knee radiographs post operative knee radiographs she received intra venous antibiotics : augmentin for 2 weeks associated with gentamicin during the first five days , as well as subcutaneous heparin . \\n she was discharged from the hospital after she was instructed to remain non - weight bearing with a follow - up in 2 weeks . \\n at 6 months follow - up , physical examination did not reveal any signs of local or deep infection . \\n her knee was pain free and she was able to walk without crutches , but she had a mild stiffness : the knee range of motion was 0/60. no antero - posterior or frontal laxities were noted . \\n clinical pictures at last follow - up showing a clean and dry wound ( 7 ) , and knee range of motion ( 8 , 9 ) clinical pictures at last follow - up showing a clean and dry wound ( 7 ) , and knee range of motion ( 8 , 9 ) . \\n the patient achieved union of the fracture : knee radiographs showed a healed patellar fracture , with hardware in place . \\n since the late 1960s , total knee arthroplasty has been the most effective treatment for knee osteoarthritis , providing good functional outcomes and improvement in the patient s quality of life . \\n constant advances in the joint replacement surgery , and especially the total knee arthroplasties have led to an increase in the number of complications following this type of surgery , such as periprosthetic fractures . [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] this entity is very challenging to treat even for the most skilled and experienced surgeons [ 7 , 8 , 10 ] . \\n the femur is the most frequent fracture site , followed by the patella and the tibia [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] . \\n patella fracture after tka can occur after trauma , or result from a stress fracture due to patella osteonecrosis , which is the most common cause of this type of fracture [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 11 ] . \\n chalidis et al ( 2007 ) have reported in a systematic review of a 752 periprosthetic patella fracture that in 88.3% of the cases , the fracture was not associated with a traumatic event , asymptomatic , and discovered during routine follow - up . \\n many risk factors of these stress fractures have been described in the previous literature [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ] including : \\n poor blood supply for patella after tka especially for antero - medial approach , and in case of lateral release or unwarranted fat pad removal : knee replacement surgery is likely to cause disruption of the vascular peri- patellar network especially the medial and the superior lateral genicular arteries.mal-alignment of the femoral and tibial implantspatella resurfacing arthroplastiesan excessive ( thickness < 15 mm ) or asymmetric bone resection during patella resurfacingosteonecrosis due

open patellar fracture above a total knee arthroplasty is a very uncommon injury , and challenging to treat . to our knowledge , \\n reported a unique case of patellar fracture associated with open knee dislocation after a total knee arthroplasty . \\n it was treated with open reduction and internal fixation of the patella with band tension wiring . \\n greco et al , reported an open tibial shaft fracture below an ipsilateral tka , managed with intramedullary nailing . \\n some factors should be considered to succeed in the management of this type of fracture such as displacement of the fracture , function of the extensor mechanism , stability of the patellar implant , remaining bone stock [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 13 ] . \\n it includes immobilization by a brace locked in full extension or a cylinder cast in case of non - operative treatment ; open reduction and internal fixation , implant revision in case of loosening , partial or total patellectomy , repair of the quadriceps tendon or patellar ligament in case of surgical treatment [ 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 ] . the periprosthetic patellar fractures are usually managed by a non - operative treatment especially for type i and ii , because of the high infectious risk of open reduction and internal fixation [ 13 , 14 ] , and consequently a high risk of arthroplasty failure . \\n literature analysis showed that conservative or non - operative treatment was more successful for the management of non - displaced patella fracture with stable implant and an intact extension mechanism . \\n ortiguera and berry reported good results in 37 out of 38 peri - prosthetic patellar fractures managed with conservative treatment . \\n dennis reported a complication rate of 39% of operative treatment ( in a series of thirty one patients who sustained a peri- prosthetic patellar fracture ) . \\n chalidis s systematic review has shown that open reduction and internal fixation failed in 92% of the cases . in this particular case , we were forced to opt for an internal fixation with a cerclage wiring after intensive wound irrigation , debridement and soft tissue repair . \\n although no conclusion can be established from a single case report , we think that the successful result in our case can be explained by the relative young age of the patient ( 56 years old ) , the good bone stock , the acute and post - traumatic characteristics of the fracture , the early and adequate management necessary to avoid infectious complication . the surgical management may reduce the ability of patella to heal because of the evacuation of peri - fractural hematoma as well as the supplementary disruption of the vascular network around the patella after a knee replacement surgery . \\n nevertheless , the high failure rate of the operative treatment in the patellar peri - prosthetic fracture can be explained by : \\n the high proportion of stress , atraumatic fracture ( 88% ) due to osteonecrosis which suggests a poor remaining bone stock.the stress fracture , unlike the acute and post traumatic ones , has a higher risk of non-union.the poor outcome of partial or complete patellectomy , which is a type of operative treatment.in our point of view , the post traumatic fractures in young patients are more likely to heal than stress fractures in the elderly . \\n  the high proportion of stress ,

\\n the poor outcome of partial or complete patellectomy , which is a type of operative treatment . in our point of view , the post traumatic fractures in young patients are more likely to heal than stress fractures in the elderly . \\n peri - prosthetic patella fracture is a very uncommon entity , and challenging to treat , especially the open ones , because of the high risk of infectious complications . \\n although several previous studies report a high rate of failure and unpredictable results of open reduction for periprosthetic patellar fracture , this approach ( especially the internal fixation with a strong and dynamic construct ) should be considered in young patients with a good remaining bone stock , who sustained an open or a displaced fracture after a high energy trauma . \\n orthopaedic surgeons should consider open reduction and internal fixation as a good management alternative for periprosthetic patellar fracture , in case of a post traumatic and acute fracture in young patients with a good bone stock .', \"hypertension is a common chronic medical condition affecting people in pakistan and the rest of the world . \\n it is an important modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality , particularly for stroke ( accounting for 51% of all stroke deaths worldwide ) , ischemic heart disease ( 45% of all deaths ) , chronic kidney disease , congestive heart failure , aortic aneurysm , and peripheral arterial disease . \\n prevalence of hypertension ( systolic blood pressure > 140  mm hg or diastolic blood pressure > 90  mm hg , or on antihypertensive medications ) in pakistan has increased from 17% in 1980 to 35% in 2008 in adults aged 18 years and older . \\n the increasing prevalence of hypertension together with a deficient control makes this one of the frequent conditions that require urgent medical attention . \\n the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension varies around the world , with the lowest prevalence in rural india ( 3.4% in men and 6.8% in women ) and the highest prevalence in poland ( 68.9% in men and 72.5% in women ) . \\n however , the control of hypertension was 23% from a community based data in urban population from karachi , pakistan . \\n uncontrolled hypertension can progress to hypertensive crisis defined as a systolic blood pressure > 180  mm hg or a diastolic blood pressure > 120  mm hg . \\n hypertensive crisis can be further classified as a hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency depending on end - organ involvement including cardiac , renal , and neurologic injury . \\n hypertensive urgency  refers to severe hypertension without evidence of new or worsening end - organ injury while  hypertensive emergency  refers to a severe hypertension that is associated with new or progressive end - organ damage . \\n hypertensive crises ( 76% urgencies , 24% emergencies ) represented more than one - fourth of all medical urgencies / emergencies . \\n hypertensive urgencies frequently present with headache ( 22% ) , epistaxis ( 17% ) , and psychomotor agitation ( 10% ) and hypertensive emergencies frequently present with chest pain ( 27% ) , dyspnea ( 22% ) , and neurological deficit ( 21% ) . \\n the reason for uncontrolled hypertension in pakistan is high due to lack of awareness , knowledge , adherence , and attitudes of pakistani patients with hypertension . \\n however there is no data on patients with hypertensive crisis from tertiary care hospitals in pakistan . \\n additionally the number of patients who complicate towards stroke , myocardial infarction , and chronic kidney disease is also not known . \\n hence , it is essential to have figures on prevalence and clinical presentation from our setup . therefore , we conducted this study to determine the prevalence of hypertensive crisis , its management , and its outcome in patients presenting to a tertiary care center in karachi . \\n this was a retrospective study conducted at the aga khan university , karachi , pakistan . \\n the aga khan university hospital ( akuh ) has 563 beds in operation and provides services to over 50,000 hospitalized patients and

hg or diastolic blood pressure ( dbp ) < 90  mm hg . \\n uncontrolled hypertension was defined as sbp > 140  mm hg and dbp > 90  mm hg in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients who were either aware of their problem or under pharmacological treatment . \\n the sample was drawn using computerized medical record system international classification of diseases-9-coordination and maintenance ( icd-9-cm ) at health information management system in the hospital . \\n patients admitted with primary diagnosis of hypertension crisis , uncontrolled hypertension , hypertensive emergency , and hypertensive urgency were selected through the icd-9-cm ( i-10 : essential ( primary ) hypertension , i-11 : hypertensive heart disease , i-12 : hypertensive renal disease , i-13 : hypertensive heart and renal disease , and i-15 : secondary hypertension ) . \\n patients whose medical records did not contain minimal clinical information to allow case classification ( hypertensive urgency or emergency ) were excluded from the study . \\n data over a period of 5 years , from year 2005 till year 2010 , was used . a sample of 1336 consecutive patients fulfilling the inclusion criterion was selected . \\n all patients gave a general consent on admission ; however informed consent was not taken as data was extracted later through icd-9-cm . \\n data on demographics , comorbid conditions , clinical symptoms , blood pressure readings at subsequent time intervals , length of stay , and antihypertensive drug therapy was recorded by trained data collectors . \\n a history of physician - diagnosed diabetes mellitus ( dm ) , chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) , ischemic heart disease ( ihd ) , and stroke was noted from the patient 's medical record file . \\n dm was defined as fasting plasma glucose 126  mg / dl at a prior visit . \\n ckd was defined as rise in serum creatinine of > 1.2  mg / dl for 3 months . \\n blood pressure readings , at different time intervals , were recorded from vital sheets for nursing services . \\n hypertensive crisis was defined as a systolic blood pressure > 180  mm hg or a diastolic blood pressure > 120  mm hg . \\n management of patient was assessed by recording the list of medication from the computer generated pharmacy sheet attached inside the medical record file . \\n antihypertensive treatment was divided into two types : medication given per oral and medications given intravenously . \\n i values where available were recorded using the patient profile viewer , an online hospital database software . \\n mean length of stay was recorded by calculating the time interval between the patient 's admission date / time and discharge date / time from er / ward . \\n various complications like myocardial infarction , stroke , aortic dissection , acute renal failure , and pulmonary edema developed during the hospital stay were recorded using the discharge summary notes filled by the primary consultant . \\n myocardial infarction was diagnosed when blood levels of sensitive and specific biomarkers such as cardiac troponin or ckmb are increased in the clinical setting of acute myocardial ischemia with electrocardiographic changes . according to who definition , \\n stroke was defined as a rapidly developing clinical sign of focal ( at times global ) disturbance of cerebral function , lasting more than 24 hours or leading to death with no apparent cause other than that of vascular origin . \\n aortic dissection was referred as the condition when a separation has occurred in aortic wall intima as diagnosed on ct scan , causing blood flow into a new false channel composed of the inner and outer layers of the media . \\n acute renal failure was diagnosed when the plasma urea nitrogen ( pun ) or serum creatinine did not stabilize within 72 hours . \\n acute pulmonary edema was defined as alveolar or interstitial edema verified by chest x - ray and/or with o2 saturation < 90% on room air prior to treatment accompanied by severe respiratory distress , with crackles over the lungs and orthopnea . \\n a minimum sample size of 237 patients was required to estimate a proportion of 19% of patients with hypertensive crises presenting to er , with bound on error of 5% and alpha of 5% . \\n mean and standard deviation were used for qualitative variables and frequency and percentage for qualitative variables . \\n chi - square test was used to compare categorical variables and student 's t - test was used to compare quantitative variables . \\n a total of 73,063 hypertensive patients presented to the er between years 2005 and 2010 out of which a sample of 1336 ( 1.8% ) patients was taken for this study . the prevalence ( % ) of uncontrolled hypertension was 28.9% ( 387 ) . \\n prevalence of hypertensive crisis overall was 16.3% ( 218 ) and among those with uncontrolled hypertension is 56.3% ( 218 ) . \\n mean age ( sd ) of patients presenting to the er was 56.7 ( 14.7 ) and 175% ( 45.2 ) of patients were male . \\n overall , dyslipidemia was the most common comorbidity in patients presenting with uncontrolled hypertension to the er with the prevalence of 43.2% ( 167 ) followed by diabetes mellitus , 36.9% ( 143 ) , and ischemic heart disease , 21.4% ( 83 ) , and 13.9% ( 54 ) of them were smokers . \\n the baseline characteristics of patients overall , with hypertensive crisis and without hypertensive crisis , are given in table 1 . \\n headache was the most common presenting symptom , 35.7% ( 138 ) , followed by dyspnea , 32.6% ( 126 ) , chest pain , 21.4% ( 83 ) , dizziness , 21.2% ( 82 ) , vomiting , 17.3% ( 67 ) , epistaxis , 5.2% ( 20 ) , and neurologic deficit , 3.6% ( 14 ) . \\n on comparison of patients with hypertensive crisis with those with no hypertensive crisis the clinical symptoms that were statistically significant were as follows : headache was present in 42.2% ( 92 ) versus 27.2% ( 46 ) p value = 0.002 and chest pain was present in 17.4% ( 38 ) versus 26.6% ( 45 ) p value = 0.02 . \\n the mean ( sd ) systolic blood pressure ( sbp ) recorded in patients with hypertensive crisis versus no hypertensive crisis in er was 202 ( 17.971 ) and 158 ( 13.387 ) ( p value  0.001 ) . \\n the mean ( sd ) diastolic blood pressure in patients with hypertensive crisis versus no hypertensive crisis in er was 108 ( 17.429 ) mm hg and 87 ( 14.984 ) mm hg , respectively , ( p value  0.001 ) . \\n the trend of blood pressure recorded in the er is shown in figures 1 and 2 . \\n antihypertensive medications used in management of patients with hypertensive crisis . \\n calcium channel blocker was the most widely used oral antihypertensive medication in the er , 35.4% ( 137 ) . \\n intravenous ( iv ) nitrate was the most commonly administered iv medication in er , 22.7% ( 88 ) . \\n the mean ( sd ) drop in sbp in patients with hypertensive crisis who received intravenous medications versus oral medications was 53.1 ( 29 ) mm hg and 43 ( 27 ) , respectively ( p value = 0.01 ) . \\n the mean drop in dbp in patients with hypertensive crisis who received intravenous versus perioral medications was 25.8 ( 19 ) and mm hg and 17.8 ( 22 ) mm hg , respectively ( p value = 0.006 ) . \\n comparison of blood pressure trends in patients with and without hypertensive crisis on intravenous or per oral medication is shown in table 2 . the maximum drop in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure \\n was achieved by sodium nitroprusside : 80 ( 15 ) mm hg and 37.5 ( 7.77 ) mm hg . \\n types of intravenous medications and drop in sbp and dbp are shown in table 3 . \\n the total length of stay ( in days ) for patients with hypertensive crisis was 2.46 ( 0.164 ) whereas the total length of stay ( in days ) for patients without hypertensive crisis was 2.20 ( 0.158 ) . \\n overall prevalence ( % ) of complications was 47.7% ( 104 ) in patients with hypertensive crisis . \\n acute renal failure was the most common complication with the prevalence ( % ) of 41.3% ( 43 ) followed by myocardial infarction 28.8% ( 30 ) and pulmonary edema 18.26% ( 19 ) . \\n stroke accounted for 6.5% ( 12 ) of complications . on comparison of patients with hypertensive crisis and patients without it , myocardial infarction occurred in 7.2% ( 15 ) versus 9% ( 15 ) , stroke occurred in 2.4% ( 5 ) versus 4.2% ( 7 ) , and acute kidney injury occurred in 11.5% ( 24 ) versus 11.4% ( 19 ) patients , respectively . \\n on further categorization of patients with hypertensive crisis who received intravenous antihypertensive in er versus not receiving intravenous medication , there was no significant difference in the complications in both groups . \\n we have shown in this study on patients presenting to er with hypertensive crisis that the prevalence of hypertensive crisis is high ( 56.3% ) . \\n mean length of stay was longer in patients with hypertensive crisis and acute renal failure was the most common complication in these patients . \\n the incidence of hypertensive crisis was 47.22% in a study conducted in bosnia and 16% in a study conducted in brazil [ 22 , 23 ] . \\n the reasons for high prevalence of patients with hypertensive crisis in our setup are multiple . \\n lack of knowledge about control of hypertension and poor compliance to antihypertensive medications is a major issue in pakistan . \\n also , lack of proper health infrastructure in public sector leading to inability of the poor population to access healthcare adds onto the severity of hypertension in these patients . in previous studies [ 25 , 26 ] , the most frequent clinical sign of patients presenting to \\n the er was headache ( 22% and 42% ) and dizziness was reported among 30% of emergency department patients . \\n this study showed ( 36% ) headache as the most common clinical sign followed by dizziness ( 21% ) which supports the previous findings about the characteristics of hypertensive crisis patients . \\n complications of hypertensive crisis reported in previous studies conducted in bahrain and italy were acute coronary syndrome ( 32% ) , left ventricular heart failure ( 38% ) , and stroke ( 29.3% )   and cerebral infarction ( 24% ) , pulmonary edema ( 23% ) , and hypertensive encephalopathy ( 16% ) . \\n however acute renal failure , myocardial infarction , and pulmonary edema are the most common complications in our setup . \\n the reason for high prevalence of acute renal failure in our setup may be the higher number of patients with hypertensive emergency . \\n the most common intravenous medication used to control hypertensive crisis in this study was nitrates . \\n recommendation for use of intravenous nicardipine was reported by a study conducted in 2005   whereas sodium nitroprusside , because of its direct vasodilator effect and immediate onset of action , was recommended for hypertensive emergency in a subsequent study in 2006 . \\n we observed in this study that sodium nitroprusside was the most potent intravenous antihypertensive in dropping blood pressure . \\n however it was not the most commonly used drug in this study . in a similar study , \\n intravenous labetalol was reported as the most frequently used antihypertensive medication for emergency department patients presenting with hypertensive urgency . \\n this indicates that the use of intravenous nitrate as the most common antihypertensive for management of hypertensive crisis ( apart from use in patients with cardiac cause ) is not completely in accordance with the recommendations . \\n however in some studies , oral labetalol , beta blockers , diuretics , ace inhibitors , and calcium channel blockers have been recommended . \\n calcium channel blockers have also been found to be the most common antihypertensives used for management of hypertensive in this population and have been found to have good control rates . \\n calcium channel is now recommended as a first line antihypertensive in the recent nice guidelines . \\n the reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure reported in our study shows a smooth decline in order to avoid risks of potential side effects of a much rapid decline . \\n it is recommended that the initial reduction in mean arterial pressure ( map ) in case of hypertensive emergency should not be more than 20%25% below the pretreatment blood pressure or that map be reduced within the first 3060 minutes to 110115  mm hg . \\n this can be comparable to our study which reported an overall decrease of blood pressure of about 52  mm hg in sbp from intravenous medication from the time of admission until 2 hours after admission in er . \\n a rapid decline in blood pressure is associated with acute deterioration in renal function , ischemic , cardiac , or cerebral events , and occasional retinal artery occlusion and acute blindness . \\n the goal is to reduce bp by 1015% over a period of 3060 minutes , with the exception of the patient that presents with aortic dissection or acute intracranial bleed . \\n however treatment should be individualized to each patient based on the type and extent of end - organ damage , degree of bp elevation , and the specific side effects that each medication could have on a patient 's preexisting comorbidities . \\n the strength of this study is that it is the first study from this region to report figures on prevalence of hypertensive crisis , as well as prevalence of complications as a result of hypertensive crisis among patients . \\n moreover , this study also reports management of these patients in terms of the treatment received in the er and into the ward and their mean length of stay . \\n however there are limitations in this study ; firstly it has limited external validity as the sample is not representative for an entire population . \\n it represents population visiting a single - tertiary care hospital and , hence , it is not representative of the entire population of pakistan . \\n secondly , compliance issues with the medication regimen have not been taken into consideration ; hence , the medications administered to the patients may be misjudged . \\n thirdly , some patients may also have gotten discharged against medical advice ; hence , the optimal length of stay for these patients may not have been achieved . \\n fourth , this retrospective study can not strongly give a cause and effect association and we have not reported the hypertensive urgencies and emergencies separately . \\n we did not report data separately on hypertensive emergency and urgency and retinopathy could not be examined and reported in all patients . \\n the prevalence of hypertensive crisis is high in our subjects . per oral calcium channel blocker and intravenous nitrate are the most commonly administered medications in the er and ward .\", \"many previous studies have revealed that parents , especially mothers , of children with developmental disabilities such as intellectual disabilities ( ids ) , developmental delay , and physical and sensory handicaps are more likely to show signs of psychological distress or depressive symptoms and to exhibit lower well - being than parents of typically developing children [ 15 ] . \\n it is generally accepted that caring for a child who has a developmental disability may involve significant and prolonged periods of time and energy . \\n since the majority of this increased daily care - giving burden for these children is carried by their parents , they are supposed to have an increased risk for high levels of stress , and thus some cases may be linked to depression [ 7 , 8 ] . \\n recently , the mental health needs of adults with i d have also been taken up for discussion . \\n studies have revealed that psychiatric disorders are more prevalent in people with i d compared within the general population . \\n specialist psychiatric services for people with i d are available in some countries such as the uk and the usa ; however , the provision of high - quality psychiatric services remains a major concern in many countries . \\n . evidently , the current psychiatric services in japan are not adequate to meet the complex mental health needs of people with i d appropriately , sensitively , and effectively . \\n failure to provide services that meet the needs of these individuals may lead to problems such as high - level caregiver stress and inappropriate therapy . \\n the paucity of trained psychiatrists and other allied professionals is a major barrier to the development of this subspecialty in many countries . in japan , \\n high - quality psychiatric services for the parents of children with i d are assumed to be not well established . \\n so far , the major portion of resources has been directed to the treatment of and services connected with the children , and not enough attention has been paid to the actual mental condition and needs of the parents . to our knowledge , there have been no reports on a nationwide scale on the mental health and distress of parents having children with developmental disabilities in japan . since the understanding of the parents ' \\n mental health may be essential for providing more appropriate support , we aimed to obtain a clear perspective on the situation facing the parents through this facility - based nationwide study . \\n the current survey included 1,102 institutions and consultation centers for children with developmental disabilities distributing in all prefectures in japan , which were listed in the national register of agencies , organizations , and institutions related to intellectual disabilities   and the directory of support centers for individuals with developmental disabilities . \\n in japan , these institutions and centers play a key role in social support networks . \\n professional workers in these facilities come into contact with children as their clients , and also with the children 's guardians , mainly with the mothers , on a daily basis . \\n the questionnaire was written in japanese and was divided into two sections with a total of 47 multiple choice questions . \\n the first section sought information about the characteristics of the facility , such as staff adequacy , the scale of the facility , the health promotion services provided , the ages of their clients , and the clients ' main disabilities , namely , i d , pervasive developmental disorder ( pdd ) , profound intellectual and multiple disabilities ( pimd ) , physical disabilities , and others . \\n the second section sought information about the clients ' parents , such as signs of mental health distress and their needs , from the professional caregivers ' point of view . \\n also measures taken by the professional caregivers when encountering distressed parents were asked in detail . \\n questionnaires were mailed in october 2008 , with an explanatory letter to the person in charge of each institution or consultation center . when agreement was met to participate in this study , one or more service providers in each facility completed the questionnaire based on all sources of information available . \\n the questionnaire was to be returned unsigned , using the stamped , self - addressed envelope enclosed . for ethical considerations , the information disclosed in the questionnaire was in a form which made it impossible to identify the facility and clients \\n this study was approved and carried out under the supervision of the japan league on developmental disabilities ( jidd ) . \\n the statistical analysis including the chi - squared test was performed with the aid of the statistical package for the social sciences 15.0 ( spss japan , inc . ) . \\n a two - sided p value of 0.05 or less was considered to be statistically significant . answers to open - ended questions \\n a total of 460 out of 1,102 facilities replied within four weeks , the response rate being 41.7% . according to the clients ' main disabilities , \\n each facility was classified into the following categories : i d , pdd , pimd , physical disability group , and others ( table 1 ) . \\n the last group was small in number and diverse in character and also included responders who provided incomplete information ; thus , data from this group were omitted from analysis hereafter . \\n also in table 1 , the number of clients ( mean persons per facility ) as an index of facility scale , their mean age , and proportion of male gender are shown . \\n their average age ( sd ) was 44.7 ( 9.5 ) years old for the i d group , 53.0 ( 7.6 ) for the pdd group , 48.3 ( 8.4 ) for the pimd group , and 55.3 ( 4.9 ) for the physical disability group . \\n 373 out of the 415 facilities ( about 90% ) experienced cases with difficulties when communicating with the clients ' parents . \\n the percentage was high regardless of the children 's disabilities , being concretely highest in the pdd group ( 96.9% ) and lowest in the physical disability group ( 86.7% ) . \\n the proportion of such parents , out of the total , was reported to be  almost none  ( 5% or less ) or  few  ( less than one fourth of the clients ) in most of the facilities ( table 2 ) . \\n it should be noted that in the i d and pdd groups , about 15% of the facilities responded that  about half  or more of the parents were difficult to communicate with . in all groups , \\n the characteristics of the i d and pdd groups were similar to each other , while the pimd and physical disability groups resembled each other . \\n in other words , in the i d and pdd groups , slightly more difficulties were experienced with the fathers compared to in the pimd and physical disability groups , where they experienced more difficulties with other family members such as the grandparents and siblings compared to the i d and pdd groups . \\n the primary reason for these difficulties was thought to be the parent 's personal condition , such as poor mental health ( table 2 ) . \\n this was especially true for the i d and pdd groups [ (df = 9 ) = 41.9 , p < 0.001 ] . in the pimd and physical disability groups , \\n the parent 's poor socio - economic status and heavy care - giving burden , reflecting the child 's level of disability , were considered to be major factors in approximately one - third of the cases . \\n signs of depression or a depressive state were the most common psychiatric disturbances seen in the parents . among the four groups , the pdd group most commonly experienced cases which showed signs of depression or a depressive state in parents . \\n the proportion of such parents was approximately 70% of the total [ (df = 12 ) = 65.1 , p < 0.001 ] . \\n well - treated cases were only 5% out of the total ; thus , most of these conditions were considered to be not medically well treated . \\n for further analysis , we selected 159 cases where symptoms of depression or a depressive state were reported in a descriptive manner . according to these reports , \\n we asked about the time of the onset , that is , whether it was prior to the birth of the child , when the parent first noticed the child 's disability , or after the child had been fully medically diagnosed . apart from the answer \\n unknown  which accounted for approximately half of the cases ,  prior to the birth of the child  was relatively common in the pdd group ( 22.1% ) , whereas \\n after the child had been fully medically diagnosed  was relatively common in the pimd ( 23.5% ) and physical disability groups ( 28.6% ) . \\n when a parent suffered from signs of psychiatric disturbances , more than half of the children experienced maltreatment . \\n physical neglect was most common in all groups , accounting for about 50% of the cases . in comparison with the other groups , in the pdd group , the child was likely to be emotionally disturbed and confined indoors ( 32.6% ) , in the pimd group , the child was mostly confined indoors ( 33.3% ) , and in the physical disability group , medical care neglect made the utilization of medical and welfare support impossible ( 50% ) [ (df = 12 ) = 27.6 , p = 0.006 ] . \\n the leading measures were gathering and disclosure of necessary information , discussion among service providers within the facility about ways to deal with the parent , protection of the child by providing a safe environment , making approaches to other family members for cooperation , intensive collaboration with other organizations such as institutions and consultation centers for better community support , and medical support for the parent provided by specialists such as physicians and psychologists . \\n many factors were reported to affect the mental health of parents . the presence or absence of support from other family members ( \\n i.e. , a spouse ) and the existence ( or not ) of a medical condition in the parent were major factors ( table 5 ) . \\n practical use ( or not ) of social support networks , whether the child 's level of disability was severe or not , and parent participation in face - to - face family support groups or not were also thought to be influential factors . in all groups , regardless of the child 's disability , more direct welfare support for the child was considered to be helpful and thus requested to be improved , in order to meet the mental health needs of the parent . besides this , in the physical disability group , family support groups , in the pimd group , support ( including financial support ) for other family members , and in the i d and pdd groups , support for other family members ( mainly siblings and the other parent ) and medical treatment of the parent 's psychiatric disturbance were also emphasized . to fulfill the demanded future role of their facility \\n , respondents expressed the importance of more collaboration with other institutions and consultation centers and the necessity for more special training courses targeting support professionals and recognized the urgent demand for more specialists especially psychologists who can support the mental health needs of both the children and their parents . \\n in the present study , we surveyed institutions and consultation centers for children with developmental disabilities in japan , which play a central role in the social support networks . \\n this facility - based nationwide survey revealed the situation facing the parents of children with i d and other developmental disabilities from the professional caregivers ' point of view . \\n almost all of the facilities experienced difficulties in keeping good relations with the clients ' parents , regardless of the children 's disabilities , and the majority of service providers noted that the proportion of such parents , out of the total , was roughly between 5 and 25% , and still increasing . \\n the primary reason for these difficulties was thought to be the parent 's condition , such as their mental health and background . \\n also , signs of depression or a depressive state were assumed to be the most common psychiatric disturbance seen . \\n these results suggested that thorough consideration of the parents ' mental health needs , especially prevention of depressive conditions and support for parents suffering from them , is urgent - demanded task for facilities . \\n i d , attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ad / hd ) , and pdd are common developmental disorders , and the latter two are noted to have substantial genetic components . \\n it has been reported that a lifetime prevalence of major mood disorders is higher in parents of children with autism and that the onset for the majority was prior to the birth of their child with autism . \\n family history studies of autism consistently uncovered a large subgroup with a high incidence of major mood disorders among family members , suggesting the two entities are related clinically and genetically [ 19 , 20 ] . \\n the findings of the present survey must be interpreted allowing for the limitations of the use of unconfirmed data reported by professional caregivers ' who come into contact with children as their clients , and their parents on a day - to - day basis . evidently , the service providers ' perspective on parental mental health was consistent with previous reports from western countries on major mood disorders and pdd . \\n in other words , facilities where the clients were diagnosed as having pdd experienced significantly more cases of parents with signs of a depressive state compared to other facilities , and the onset of depression was considered to be prior to the birth of the child in many of the cases . although these professional caregivers were well trained and well experienced , only , one - third were physicians , nurses or psychologists . on account of the limitations of these data , \\n we emphasize confirming the diagnoses of psychiatric disturbances through direct contact with the parents by specialists such as psychiatrists is necessary in future studies , for accurate understanding of the overall problem . in japan \\n , there is no official system to check and document the parents ' condition including their mental health status . \\n parents are not accustomed to being asked about their own mental health , so there is a tendency to avoid discussion on matters concerning themselves . \\n this was the major reason why we asked the professional caregivers about the parents ' condition , not the parents directly , in this study . \\n but still we judged it to be worthwhile at this moment to summarize the professional caregivers ' impression on this issue , since the case in japan has never been described in detail despite of its importance . because the majority of burden for daily care of handicapped children is typically carried by mothers , particular concern is raised for their adaptation . in the past studies , the psychosocial outcomes in mothers \\n were said to be better predicted by psychosocial factors such as more active social life and family resources . \\n recent research focusing on parenting stress illustrated the value of the participation of fathers also . \\n greater marital quality predicted lower parenting stress for both mothers and fathers , while greater social support predicted increased parenting efficacy for fathers . \\n although the relationship between child characteristics and parental well - being has not reached an invariable agreement , the severity of a child 's disability , intellectual functioning , and so forth are generally considered to be risk factors . since the burden for daily care is mainly carried by the mother , similarly in japan , service providers tend to be in contact with the mother more frequently than other family members \\n . this may be partially the reason why service providers experienced difficulties in communicating with mostly the mothers in this study . \\n the presence of support from other family members , such as a spouse , is considered to be a major influential factor for the mental health of parents in japan also . \\n practical use of social support networks such as participation in face - to - face family support groups , more financial support for the household , more direct welfare support for the child , and medical treatment of the parent 's psychiatric disturbance were reported to be helpful and thus requested to be improved , in order to meet the mental health needs of the parent . \\n we would like to emphasize the fact that although the importance of medical treatment for the parents ' psychiatric disturbances was pointed out , it was also realized that these conditions were presently not being medically well treated . \\n this shows that current psychiatric services in japan are not adequate to meet the complex mental health needs of the parents appropriately . to resolve this challenging issue , \\n more intensive collaboration between other child - care facilities and organizations , aiming at the mental health needs of the parents , is demanded . \\n the paucity of trained psychiatrists and other allied professionals also needs to be addressed , and in order to fulfill this , sufficient discussion and research on the establishment of an effective training system for specialists is warranted . providing direct advice for the parents on the utilization of social support networks is a reliable measure that can be immediately taken . \\n training more professionals who can properly deal with the parents ' mental health needs is an urgent matter that must be tackled . \\n overall , the present study is the first nationwide survey that examined the professional caregivers ' perspective on the mental health of parents of children with developmental disabilities , and it underscores the importance of understanding and supporting the parents ' mental health needs , which leads to more appropriate support for children with developmental disabilities .\", 'in may 2001 , 24 cases of s. typhimurium dt160 salmonellosis were reported in the auckland region compared with an average of four sporadic cases each month with this serotype in the previous 7 months . \\n raw and undercooked egg consumption was commonly reported by the first 10 case - patients interviewed . \\n a case - control study and environmental investigation were undertaken to identify the vehicle of infection and source of the outbreak . \\n recognizing the potential for a widely dispersed foodborne outbreak , we expanded the investigation throughout new zealand . \\n we defined a case as diarrhea ( 3 loose stools in a 24-hour period ) or vomiting after april 28 , 2001 , with a stool specimen positive for s. typhimurium dt160 . \\n patients were excluded if they had a history of contact with another person with culture - confirmed s. typhimurium dt160 infection , or if they had a history of recent overseas travel . each case \\n was matched with two controls found from randomly drawn telephone numbers , matching for neighborhood and age ( < 1 , 14 , 514 , > 14 years ) . \\n the questionnaire covered symptoms ( patients only ) and contact with other symptomatic persons , bird or animal contact , and food consumption in the 3-day period before onset of illness ( cases and controls ) . parents or guardians were interviewed on behalf of children ages < 12 years . \\n stepwise conditional logistic regression analyses were performed , also using sas , to identify the combination of variables that best explained the differences between case - participants and controls . \\n samples from the drinking water supply of case - patients with a history of recent consumption of nonreticulated water were collected and tested for coliforms and s. enterica by using standard methods ( 6 ) . \\n brands of eggs eaten raw within the incubation period were sampled at random from retail displays at the case - patients purchase site . \\n eggshell surfaces and contents were tested with standard methods ( 7 ) . broken or cracked eggs were excluded from analysis . \\n salmonella isolates were serotyped by using the kauffman - white scheme ( 8) and s. typhimurium isolates were phage typed by using the laboratory of enteric pathogens method ( 9 ) . from may \\n to august 2001 , a total of 170 case - patients meeting the case definition were identified . of these , 119 ( 70% ) \\n agreed to participate and were enrolled in the study , along with 235 matched controls . \\n the median age of case - patients was 8 years ( range 4 months to 90 years ) , and 57% were female . \\n the most frequently reported symptoms were diarrhea ( 97% ) , abdominal pain ( 77% ) , excessive tiredness ( 67% ) , and fever ( 66% ) . \\n the median duration of illness was 7 days ( range 144 days ) ; 17 ( 15% ) patients were hospitalized , and none died . \\n case - patients and controls did not differ significantly according to age , sex , immunosuppressive therapy , treatment to reduce gastric acidity , or use of antibiotics . \\n all s. typhimurium dt160 isolates were sensitive to ampicillin , cephalothin , chloramphenicol , ciprofloxacin , co - trimoxazole , gentamicin , streptomycin , sulfonamides , tetracycline , and trimethoprim . \\n four represented different levels of contact with other persons with gastrointestinal illness ( i.e. , within 28 days of illness onset ; within 3 days of onset ; within the household ; or outside the household ) . direct handling of dead wild birds , consumption of fast food , and consumption of food at a large gathering , such as at a party or large barbecue , were also significantly associated with illness . \\n after stepwise regression , contact with a person with gastrointestinal illness in the 28 days before onset of illness in the case - patient ( adjusted odds ratio [ or ] 2.8 ; 95% confidence interval [ ci ] 1.4 to 5.4 ) , exposure to dead wild birds ( adjusted or 10.5 ; 95% ci 2.3 to 47.5 ) , and consumption of fast food ( adjusted or 1.7 ; 95% ci 1.0 to 2.9 ) had independent significant associations with illness . \\n dt , definitive type ; d&v , diarrhea and vomiting ; or , odds ratio ; ci , confidence interval . \\n twelve case - patients throughout new zealand indicated that they had drunk water from nonreticulated and untreated water sources . \\n seven patients used roof - collected rainwater , and one used rainwater plus water from a dam . \\n four of the five patients who had eaten raw eggs could identify the retail brand and outlet of purchase . \\n these four patients had purchased six different brands of eggs from seven different retail outlets . \\n samples for two brands were positive for s. thompson , both from shell surface washings . \\n epidemiologic investigation of an outbreak of s. typhimurium dt160 infection in new from may to august 2001 found that contact with dead wild birds , contact with other persons with gastrointestinal illness , and consumption of fast food were all significantly associated with illness . \\n in addition , s. typhimurium dt160 was found in roof - collected rainwater drunk by five patients . \\n s. typhimurium dt160 had been previously identified as the cause of large numbers of sparrow deaths in new zealand in 2000 , and analysis by pulsed - field gel electrophoresis ( using the method described by barrett et al \\n .   and restriction enzyme xbai ) demonstrated that bird and human isolates in 2000 were indistinguishable ( 4 ) . in our study , information was not collected on exposure to environments contaminated by wild bird feces , such as parks and play areas , a fact that may have underestimated the avian contribution to human illness . \\n s. typhimurium dt160 has previously been recognized as a bird pathogen in canada ( 11 ) and in england ( 12 ) . before its emergence in new zealand , the human s. typhimurium \\n dt160 infection had only been reported in the context of a 1979 institutional outbreak in the united kingdom , linked to food contamination by sparrow droppings ( 13 ) . \\n consumption of undisinfected water has previously been identified as a risk factor for salmonellosis linked to bird transmission ( 14 ) . \\n this risk factor was not confirmed by our case - control study , despite the finding of s. typhimurium dt160 in roof - collected rainwater . \\n this discrepancy is probably because case - patients and controls were matched by neighborhood , and types of water sources are usually consistent within neighborhoods . \\n the association of illness with contact with another person with gastrointestinal illness is likely underestimated because secondary salmonellosis cases were excluded . \\n consumption of fast food was associated with illness ; however , no single type of food outlet or food was identified . \\n case - patients were equally likely to have eaten food from chain fast - food restaurants as from family - owned fast - food outlets . \\n consumption of fast food may have occurred in environments contaminated by bird feces , or the foods themselves may have been contaminated , either during production or by infected foodhandlers ( 15 ) . \\n asymptomatic salmonella carriers would not have been excluded from selection as controls , potentially reducing the magnitude of observed associations . \\n recall may have been influenced by delays between exposure and interview , although participants were asked to refer to a memory aid ( personal diary or calendar ) . \\n the investigation successfully excluded a single common source exposure for this outbreak and instead suggested that multiple exposures contribute to s. typhimurium dt160 infections in new zealand . \\n strategies for addressing these exposures include routine treatment of roof - collected rainwater , hygienic disposal of dead birds , and promotion of hand - hygiene protocols and sick foodhandler policies in fast - food outlets . \\n the source of this incursion of s. typhimurium dt160 into new zealand remains unknown : bird isolates have been exclusively from nonmigratory birds , s. typhimurium dt160 has not been identified in neighboring countries in the pacific basin , and early case - patients did not have a history of overseas travel .', 'non - crystallographic symmetry ( ncs ) is common in macromolecular crystals , occurring in about 1/3 or more of structures in the protein data bank [ 2 , 3 , 24 ] . though non - crystallographic symmetry increases the complexity of structure determination , in most cases it yields a distinct advantage in this process because it brings with it information on relationships between density in different parts of the crystal and between coordinates in different parts of the structure [ 4 , 1214 ] . \\n these relationships greatly improve density modification and refinement , two key steps in structure determination . \\n one is simple examination of a model that has more than one copy of a chain . \\n it can be used after molecular replacement has been carried out or after a model has been built . \\n another approach is to find symmetry relationships among subsets of atoms in a heavy - atom or anomalously scattering atom substructure [ 11 , 17 ] . \\n these symmetry relationships often reflect non - crystallographic symmetry , and the presence of the ncs can be checked by comparison of the density in the resulting electron density map at ncs - related positions and orientations . \\n this approach can be used near the beginning of a sad , mad , or other structure determination where a substructure is obtained prior to full structure determination . \\n this approach may be difficult to apply if there are only one or two atoms per ncs copy in the substructure and the ncs does not have point - group symmetry . \\n this is because the relative orientations of the ncs - related parts of the substructure are not known in this case . \\n a third approach that can be applied in cases where proper ncs ( e.g. , a two - fold axis ) is present is to search for locations in a map where nearby points related by proper symmetry have similar density . \\n a fourth and very general approach to finding non - crystallographic symmetry is to find patterns of density that are present in more than one part of an electron density map . \\n used a step - wise procedure of first finding possible c locations with pattern - matching techniques , classifying the locations with rotation - invariant classifiers , and then finding pairs of these locations that have similar patterns of density surrounding them . \\n this method can be fast and effective , but has the potential limitations that the map has to be of high enough quality to locate c positions and that for maximal speed the patterns of density need to be initially represented in a rotation - invariant fashion . here \\n we present an approach to finding non - crystallographic symmetry by directly searching for patterns of density that are present in more than one place in a map . \\n this approach uses superposition of a cut - out region of the map with the remainder of the map , and therefore can make use of all the local features in a map , not just rotation - invariant ones . in this approach , an fft - based convolution search [ 5 , 16 ] \\n is used to find orientations and translations that relate parts of a map to other parts of a map . \\n we find that this is a rapid and accurate way to identify ncs , even in a case where the map is poor and the correlation of ncs - related density is low . \\n the approach used here to identify non - crystallographic symmetry from an electron density map has three basic parts . \\n first , a location in the map is found that is likely to be inside the molecule . \\n this is important as it is the local symmetry of the molecule or molecules in the crystal that are of interest , so considering a region inside the molecule is essential for success . \\n the method used to identify such a location in the map is similar to a method commonly used to distinguish macromolecule from solvent in a map . for each grid point in the electron density map , the local rms variation in electron density is calculated . \\n this is done by simply calculating the standard deviation of the density in the map inside a sphere with radius r ( typically 10   ) , centered at the grid point in question . \\n then the grid point in the map with the highest local standard deviation of density is considered the best candidate for a position inside the macromolecule . \\n additional points likely to be inside the macromolecule can optionally be found by choosing additional grid points with high local variation in density that are well separated ( typically at least 15   ) from previously chosen locations . \\n next , a search for ncs relating the density near the candidate point inside the macromolecule with density elsewhere in the asymmetric unit of the crystal is carried out . to make the calculation rapid \\n , the resolution of the map used for this calculation may be chosen to be lower than the resolution of the original map ( typically a resolution of 4   is used ) \\n . a sphere of density ( typically with a radius of 10   ) is cut out of the map , centered at this position within the molecule . \\n this sphere of density is the object that is to be compared with density everywhere in the map . \\n possible rotations of this sphere of density are sampled ( typically each rotation differing by about 20 degrees from all others ) . for each rotation , \\n the density is transformed to the new orientation , and an fft - based convolution search [ 5 , 16 ] is used to identify non - crystallographic translations that yield a high correlation of density . \\n these rotation / translation pairs that yield high correlation ( typically all those at or above 75  % of the highest value found ) represent a possible set of ncs operators relating the various copies of the molecule in the asymmetric unit of the unit cell . \\n additionally , the candidate point used to identify ncs and the ncs - related points in the map may be considered approximate centers of regions where ncs applies . they are used below as the starting point for identification of the region where ncs operators apply . \\n once a set of candidate ncs operators is obtained , the correlation of ncs - related density is examined in the original map , and the ncs operators are refined . \\n this is done using the same approach as has been applied to ncs operators obtained from heavy - atom positions . \\n first the shape and position of the local region that is repeated by ncs ( the asymmetric unit of ncs ) is found . \\n then the ncs operators are refined to maximize the correlation of density among these ncs - related regions . \\n the region where ncs applies is assumed to contain the point identified in the first step of our procedure that is within the macromolecule . \\n a region with arbitrary shape surrounding this point is then chosen by sequential addition of new boundary points such that the local correlation of ncs - related density at each point in the region is above a threshold ( typically 1/4 of the maximum correlation in the region ) . \\n the local correlation of density   is calculated using map grid points within a sphere ( normally with the radius used for identification of the solvent boundary , terwilliger 2000b ) , centered at the point in question . \\n if the final correlation of ncs - related density ( averaged over all pairs of ncs - related points ) is above a threshold ( typically 0.4 ) then the ncs operators are considered to represent actual ncs in the crystal and are used in later stages of structure determination . in cases where the starting map is very poor , \\n this threshold may be decreased , increasing the sensitivity of the procedure but also increasing the probability of finding ncs where none is present . \\n the approach used here to identify non -

applied our procedure to finding non - crystallographic symmetry to a structure where an electron density map of moderate quality could be obtained using mad phasing . \\n this structure ( gere , pdb entry 1fse , ) consists of 6 copies of a protein chain with 74 residues . figure  1a shows a schematic of the protein structure . \\n figure  1b , c illustrates the mad - phased electron density map for this structure for corresponding views of chains c and f , respectively , without any density modification or including any information on ncs . \\n it may be seen that this map is of moderate quality in the region of chain c and rather poorer quality in the region of chain f.fig .  1 \\n a ribbon view of 6 chains of gere in crystal structure pdb entry 1fse . \\n b view of experimental mad

ncs identification . \\n the density map was examined to find locations where the local variation of density was highest using the method phenix.guess_molecular_centers . \\n it can be seen that this point is well within the region of the map with protein - like characteristics ( relatively connected and high density ) . \\n next , after truncating the resolution of the map to 4   , test density corresponding to a sphere of radius 10   of density centered at the point marked in fig . \\n 1b was cut out ( the region inside the circle in fig .  1b , except for the change in resolution of the map ) . \\n the density within all 10   spherical regions in the 4   map was then compared to this test density using an fft - based method , sampling all possible rotations of the test density on a grid . \\n this density correlation procedure correctly identified all 5 regions that had high similarity to the test density . \\n figure  1c shows one of these related regions of density , the one corresponding to chain f of gere , in the same view as fig . \\n it may be seen that within the 10   sphere the density in fig . \\n 1b , c are similar , though the density near chain f ( fig . \\n the shape of the density becomes less similar , as expected because the protein chains surrounding the chain located outside the sphere in fig . \\n 1b have a different arrangement than those outside the sphere in fig .  1c . \\n 1c and the other 4 locations within the asymmetric unit of the density in this crystal were then refined to identify the region over which correlation of density existed and to optimize the correlation of density among all copies of this repeated density . \\n this process yields as well the transformation matrices describing the relationships among all the ncs - related copies in the asymmetric unit of the crystal . \\n the final average pair - wise correlation of density among the 6 copies was 0.53 . \\n 1b ) the average correlation to other ncs - related regions was 0.56 , while for chain f ( fig . \\n figure  1d shows the average density for all the regions of density that were found to be similar from the same viewpoint as shown in fig . \\n it can be seen that this density has features even more like those expected of a density map of a protein than the individual regions of density ( the tubes of density are better - connected ) . \\n the approach described here for finding ncs in a map can be used in a number of situations . in the phenix crystallographic software , \\n the method phenix.find_ncs_from_density is used during structure solution with phenix.autosol   if ncs is expected but can not be found from heavy - atom sites , and it is used during iterative model - building with phenix.autobuild   any time it is expected and has not been identified by any other means . \\n the ncs relationships identified in this way can be used as a powerful addition to the information available for density modification [ 4 , 1214 ] . \\n these relationships can also be used in model - building , where an incompletely built chain can be built using a more complete ncs - related copy of the same chain as a template [ 9 , 15 , 20 ] . \\n further they could potentially be used to place copies of entire chains in low - resolution maps . \\n the maps to be analyzed for ncs can be crystallographic maps , maps from electron microscopy , or maps from other sources . \\n the approach described here could also be used to find density that is similar in two different electron density maps . \\n this last application could be useful in automatically finding relationships between molecules in different crystals when carrying out cross - crystal averaging .', \"the protection of water supplies and water distribution infrastructure such as reservoirs is of great concern for those defending against bioterrorism . the us military is concerned because there exist multiple biological warfare agents ( bwas ) that could be intentionally introduced into the water supply which could have serious implications for military operations as well as civilians located within a theater of operations . to protect potable water supplies , the department of defense ( dod ) seeks to develop a rapid field test that would determine if field supplies of water are safe to drink by the warfighter during a military operation . \\n the us armed services have fielded biological defense systems that are designed to protect against a large scale attack via bwas dispersed through the air . \\n these defensive systems utilize high - efficiency aerosol collectors that impinge the sampled air into a liquid buffer which is tested for bwas using antibody - based handheld assays ( hhas ) . \\n civilian first responders use similar versions of these antibody - based hhas for testing suspicious powder samples suspected to contain bwas . depending on which manufacturer of hha \\n is being tested , the technology can be low cost , requires no electrical power , and requires minimal to no sample preparation to test a sample . \\n it was an hha panel manufactured by the dod that first identified bacillus anthracis in the powder that spilled across a desk in senator daschle 's office in the hart senate office building in 2001 . \\n three years later , a dod hha was again used to identify ricin toxin in the mail room of the dirksen senate office building . \\n these instances demonstrate that , when hha technologies are used appropriately by an experienced operator trained to understand what the results mean , they can be a useful tool . \\n additionally , hhas have proven fast and effective in the laboratory for the detection of francisella tularensis   and biotoxins such as staphylococcal enterotoxin b ( seb )   and microcystins .   the dod has initiated an effort called the joint chemical biological and radiological agent water monitor ( jcbrawm ) program to develop a system which will allow rapid field testing of drinking water supplies used by military personnel . \\n the effectiveness of hhas in detecting biological agents in the air and in powders has resulted in a desire to test these assays to gauge their effectiveness to protect drinking water supplies used by us warfighters . in the present study , hhas from multiple manufacturers were evaluated for their effectiveness at detecting two specific targets , seb and ricin , in multiple water matrices . \\n the hhas were not modified in any way to optimize for the detection of toxins within water supplies despite the fact that they were initially developed to test for concentrated agent collected from high - efficiency aerosol collectors and impinged into a phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) solution rather than to test unbuffered water supplies . \\n the ability of the hhas to detect seb and ricin in four different water matrices , representative of waters used by different branches of the armed forces , was evaluated . \\n the four different water matrices were formulated tap water , formulated tap water with 1  mg / l free available chlorine ( fac ) , water treated by reverse osmosis ( ro ) with 1  mg / l fac , and ro water with 2  mg / l total residual bromine . suggested health effect levels as used by the us military for ricin and seb are 455  ng / ml and 4.55  ng / ml , respectively . \\n these minimal health effect levels were derived using the tri service standards for field water and based on an average consumption of 10 liters per day for seven days for a 70  kg service member . therefore , detection of ricin and seb in water at or below the suggested health effect level is desired . \\n both singleplex ( one - line ) and multiplex ( two - line and two - dot ) hha models produced by two manufacturers were evaluated in the present study for the detection of ricin toxin and seb [ 5 , 6 ] . \\n active seb ( toxin technologies , sarasota , fla , usa ) and active ricin whole toxin ( vector laboratories , burlington , on , canada ) were obtained from the dod 's critical reagents program ( crp ) for use in the present study . \\n briefly , approximately 500  ml of astm type i deionized water was added to a one - liter volumetric flask to which each stock solution was added to achieve the desired final concentration and the total volume was brought to one liter with deionized water . \\n after 1520 minutes , the ph was assessed and adjusted if needed ( with minimal volume change ) to 7.67.8 . \\n once prepared , synthetic tap water was stored at 4c with a shelf life of one week . \\n briefly , one gram of calcium hypochlorite was added to twenty milliliters of astm type i deionized water and shaken vigorously for one to two minutes . \\n briefly , approximately five microliters of the chlorine stock solution ( supernatant , not solids ) was added to 100  ml of the formulated tap water or ro water , which was prepared by running local tap water through a commercial ro unit . \\n the fac was measured using a hach dr 2500 spectrophotometer per manufacturer 's instructions , and the fac level was adjusted as needed to achieve the desired fac level of 1 \\n chlorinated water was considered stable for only one day and therefore made fresh daily just prior to use . \\n briefly , 25  ml of bromine resin was transferred to a 500  ml , 0.20  m filter unit ( corning life science , lowell , mass , usa ) . \\n total residual bromine in the collected water was measured using a hach dr 2500 spectrophotometer per manufacturer 's instructions and adjusted as needed to achieve the desired final concentration of 2  mg / l . \\n each water type was prepared fresh daily as described above and spiked separately with each target at desired concentrations . \\n after spiking , 100  l of sample was loaded onto the sample well of the hha . \\n the hha was allowed to develop for 15 minutes prior to reading the result by eye . \\n each challenge concentration was tested a minimum of two independent times with a minimum of three handheld assays per concentration . \\n limits of detection ( lod ) were determined for each hha type in each water matrix and defined as the minimum concentration of toxin that could be detected by eye . \\n samples for circular dichroism ( cd ) were prepared by spiking ro water containing 1  mg / l fac with seb to a final concentration of 2  g / ml . control samples received no chlorine . \\n after 24 hours , sodium thiosulfate ( 0.005% w / v final concentration ; fisher scientific catalog number s446 ) was added to all samples to quench any remaining chlorine prior to analysis by cd . \\n cd experiments employed a jasco model j-810 spectropolarimeter ( jasco analytical instruments , easton , md , usa ) equipped with a ptc-423s peltier thermoelectric temperature control system . \\n cd spectra were obtained for seb at 25c from 260 to 190  nm with a data pitch of 0.5  nm , a band width of 1  nm , a response time of 1  sec , and a scanning speed of 10  nm / min . \\n the cd was carried out on 2  g / ml samples in 1  cm quartz cuvettes and required long - time signal averaging . \\n the concentration of seb was verified for a representative stock solution by uv absorption at 277  nm using an e for seb of 14 . \\n for each sample , the blank - subtracted cd curve for 100 averaged scans was converted to molar ellipticity using a molecular weight of 28,366 daltons and fit with the secondary structure estimation application in jasco 's spectra manager ( version 1.53.01 ) software to obtain the fraction of helix , beta sheet , turn , and random coil secondary structure . \\n the percentages reported here were obtained using the reed reference set for the secondary structure calculations . \\n samples for sds - page were prepared by spiking ro water containing 1  mg / l fac with seb to a final concentration of 2  g / ml . control samples received no chlorine . \\n after one minute , one hour , and 24 hours , sodium thiosulfate ( 0.005% w / v final concentration ) was added to all samples to quench any remaining chlorine prior to analysis by sds - page . reducing gel eletrophoresis \\n was carried out using the mini - protean 2 cell and 1020% tris - hcl pager gold precast gels from lonza ( rockland , me , usa ) . \\n fifty nanograms of seb samples and 1  :  20 diluted mark12 unstained standard ( invitrogen ) were prepared in sds sample buffer , followed by heating at 95c for 5 minutes prior to loading . \\n running buffer was prepared by dilution from 10x tris / glycine / sds buffer ( biorad ) . \\n following electrophoresis , the gel was fixed with 50% methanol and 7% acetic acid ( both v / v ) for a total of 30 minutes . \\n the rapid staining protocol with sypro ruby protein stain ( invitrogen ) was used for the detection of seb . \\n the gel was washed with a solution of 10% methanol and 7% acetic acid ( both v / v ) for 30 minutes and imaged and documented with uv light using syngene ( frederick , md , usa ) . \\n all hhas were evaluated for their performance in formulated tap water , formulated tap water with chlorine , ro water with chlorine , and ro water with bromine for the detection of ricin and seb . \\n each water type was spiked with multiple concentrations of each toxin and loaded onto hhas for testing until the lod was determined for each hha model . \\n it was determined that ricin could be detected down to approximately 1  ng / ml for most hha models in both formulated tap water and formulated tap with chlorine , while exhibiting only slightly higher lods in ro with chlorine for most models . however , in ro with bromine , the lod for ricin increased to 3,000  ng / ml for all models tested . for seb , lods in formulated tap water were low , ranging from 0.9  ng / ml to 12.5  ng / ml . however , in both chlorinated and brominated water , lods increased to 2,500  ng / ml for singleplex hhas and even higher to 5,000 or 10,000  ng / ml for multiplex models . in all cases \\n detection below the suggested health effect level was desired ; however , seb was not detected below the suggested health effect level in chlorinated and brominated water and ricin was not detected below that level in brominated water . \\n due to the increased detection limits observed in chlorinated and brominated water , cd spectroscopy , which assesses the three - dimensional fold of a protein , was performed on samples of untreated seb and seb exposed to chlorine in an effort to evaluate the basis for increased lods ( figure 1 ) . for each sample \\n , the individual cd scans were compared prior to averaging to ascertain the structural stability of the sample . \\n untreated seb at 2  g / ml was determined to contain 14.3% helix , 34.50% sheet , 17.6% turn , and 33.6% random coil ( rmsd < 0.1% ) . \\n the cd spectrum of seb treated with 1  mg / l fac was stable over the time of experimentation . \\n the curve - fitting calculation for chlorine - treated seb resulted in 25.9% helix , 0.0% sheet , 0.0% turn , and 74.1 random coil ( rmsd < 0.1% ) .   sds - page was also performed to ascertain the overall effect of chemical reaction with chlorine on the molecular weight of seb . \\n for the treated and untreated seb , 1.5  g of seb was loaded per well . as shown in figure 2 , for untreated seb , \\n the seb was visible on the gel as a band with a molecular weight of approximately 28  kda for all time points tested . for chlorine - treated seb , \\n no band was visible at the same molecular weight as untreated seb for any of the time points tested . \\n ricin and seb are considered potential biological threat agents as both can cause illness either by inhalation or ingestion . \\n seb could potentially be used to attack low - volume water supplies ; however , due to the fact that ricin is less toxic by oral ingestion , it may be a less likely threat to drinking water . \\n however , detection of both agents in water is still a concern and technologies capable of detection in water must be investigated . \\n performance of hhas for air and surfaces is well known ; however , the use of hhas for detection of agents in water is less recognized . \\n therefore , the application of hhas for detection in water was assessed in this study . in formulated tap water , detection of seb and ricin \\n was achieved at or below the suggested health effect levels for each model of hha in almost every case . \\n however , the presence of disinfectants proved problematic with regard to detecting either seb or ricin using all models of hhas . \\n the increased lods observed when disinfectants were present are believed to be due to the degradation of the target or toxins by chlorine and bromine . \\n therefore , it is likely that protein toxins would also be affected by these strong oxidants . \\n in fact , sodium hypochlorite is known to completely inactivate seb and ricin toxin [ 11 , 12 ] . \\n therefore , when exposed to chlorine or bromine , protein toxins could become damaged or denatured causing antibodies present in an antibody - based assay , such as hhas , to no longer bind to the altered antigen as effectively . \\n this decrease in binding efficiency could yield higher lods for the target , such as those observed in the present evaluation .   to address this issue , cd spectroscopy and sds - page \\n the cd results for untreated seb were similar to those obtained by singh et al . \\n for seb at 0.5 - 0.6  mg / ml in 10  mm sodium phosphate . \\n the cd results for chlorine - treated seb indicate a significant change in three - dimensional fold resulting in less well - defined structure for the chlorine - treated seb relative to the untreated seb . based on curve - fitting calculations , the percentage of random coil more than doubled upon treatment with chlorine . \\n the secondary structure percentages obtained from the cd curve - fitting routine may well represent an average of multiple seb - based species in solution , which would be consistent with the sds - page results . \\n the absence of bands for the chlorine - treated seb could occur if the seb was cleaved into smaller peptides that diffuse out of the gel or if multiple higher molecular weight species are formed , with no single species being concentrated enough to be visualized on the gel . in either of these cases , chiral components would be present in the sample and would lead to a measureable cd spectrum . the cd and \\n page results together suggest a major change in seb structure that may result in multiple seb - based antigens , the majority of which are less easily recognized and not bound as effectively as untreated seb by the antibody present on the membrane of the assay \\n . the decreased binding capacity for the seb - based antigen(s ) would account for the increased detection limits seen for seb in chlorinated water . \\n these results support the idea that increased lods in disinfected water are caused by disruption in antigen - antibody binding due to degradation of the antigen . \\n in addition to the detection studies reported herein , currently studies are being performed to address whether both ricin and seb remain active , or toxic , after exposure to chlorine and bromine . however , regardless of whether activity remains , the ability to detect the presence of each toxin in disinfected water supplies is important . \\n presence of these agents could indicate a potential compromise or attack on the water supply , thereby revealing security risks as well as potential health risks . \\n additionally , it was noted in the present study that chlorine did not impact detection levels of ricin as significantly as detection levels of seb under the test conditions employed . \\n additional exposure time may be required in order for ricin detection to be affected in the same manner as that observed for seb in chlorinated water . \\n this could be due to a difference in protein structure or stability in chlorinated water between the two toxins . \\n further tests allowing for prolonged incubation of ricin in chlorinated water prior to detection could address this issue .\", 'osteosarcoma is a common primary malignant bone tumor with complicated pathogenesis and frequent distal metastasis , thus causing higher mortality rates , especially in the teenagers . \\n epidemiological surveys revealed that nearly 40% of osteosarcoma patients died from misdiagnosis and/or early tumor metastasis , especially toward the lung tissue [ 24 ] . \\n therefore , it is of critical importance to find a simple and effective biological marker for osteosarcoma , in order to make early diagnosis . \\n current studies have revealed the role of gene mutation in the proliferation of tumor cells . \\n cell apoptosis - related genes , including

has been reported to play an important regulatory role in the progression of various malignant tumors , such as pulmonary cancer , nasopharynx cancer , and kidney cancer . \\n the fragment loss , point mutation , or methylation of p15 gene may all lead to its abnormal tumor - suppressing function , thus facilitating the malignancy and metastasis of tumor cells . \\n previous studies have been performed on the pathogenesis and related mechanisms of pulmonary metastasis of osteosarcoma , but the involvement of p15 gene has not been reported . as it is of critical importance for early

further studies also revealed significant correlation between p15 gene mutation and occurrence of osteosarcoma ( r=0.998 , p<0.05 ) . \\n due to its unfavorable prognosis , early diagnosis and treatment is of critical importance for preventing metastasis of osteosarcoma lesions . \\n the clinical features of osteosarcoma mainly include bone pain , hypercalcinemia , and osteolysis metastasis . \\n the complication of other organ / tissues , such as the lung , may indicate the metastasis of tumors . \\n the proliferation of primary tumor lesions causes the detachment of tumor cells , which penetrate vessel walls to enter the general lymph or blood circulation system for the invasion of distal tissues , where tumor  seeds \\n investigation of the mechanisms underlying the progression and metastasis of osteosarcoma is a popular research topic . \\n recent studies revealed complicated genetic processes regulating the tumor metastasis , as a  hot - spot  located in chromosome 9p21 - 22 region affects gene fragment loss or transcriptional abnormalities in various malignant tumors [ 1719 ] . \\n p15 gene , as a representative gene in this region , has been shown to have mutants and expression down - regulation in kidney and bladder cancer . in approximately 23% of cancer cells of \\n it has been indicated that single - base mutation occurs in 67 , 119 , and 135 codons of p15 gene . due to the methylation of p15 gene , \\n hematopoietic progenitor cells lose the regulation of tgf--mediated growth inhibition , which in turn increased the incidence of malignant bone tumors . \\n recent evidence suggests the complexity of the abnormal regulation of p15 gene involved in bone tumor metastasis . \\n however , the relationship between p15 gene and lung metastasis of osteosarcoma remains to be determined . \\n this study utilized umr-106 cell line , which is a classical osteosarcoma cell line induced by radioactive phosphorous isotope ( 32-p ) , to generate an osteosarcoma rat model by subcutaneous injection . \\n the observation of tumor size and pulmonary tissue damage , along with p15 gene expression at different time points after the injection , showed normal tissue structures and almost no tumor cells in the control group . after the inoculation , \\n the overall survival rate of rats was 83.3% , in which about 48% of cases had pulmonary metastasis , suggesting the effectiveness and usefulness of this model . \\n the tumor cell expression maintained at minimal level with lower mutation rate of p15 gene at 1 week after the inoculation . at 26 weeks , however , abnormal tumor - like structures began to occur in the pulmonary tissues in the model group , along with elevated p15 gene mutation rates over time . \\n the tumor - positive cell percentage in pulmonary tissues increased from 10% to more than 72% at the final time point ( 6 weeks ) , suggesting the occurrence of lung metastasis , as consistent with previous reports . \\n other studies demonstrated the suppressed incidence of esophagus cancer and pharynx squamous carcinoma by the inhibition of p15 gene methylation . \\n furthermore , p15 expression level was higher in tongue squamous carcinoma without lymph node metastasis , compared to those patients with metastasis , who also had unfavorable prognosis . \\n all these studies point to the importance of p15 gene in inhibiting tumor growth and invasion , both of which are consistent with our results in osteosarcoma . \\n the proliferation of cells is highly dependent on the complete cell cycle , whose disruption or dysfunction may directly affect the tumor growth . p15 gene , as an inhibitory factor in cell - cycle - dependent kinase ( cdk ) , exerts its function mainly on g1 phase of the cell cycle via modulating the n - terminal protein expression of multiple tumor - suppressing factors , thereby inhibiting the abnormal growth of various malignant tumor cells . \\n the correlation between p15 gene mutation in peripheral blood cells and the growth curve of osteosarcoma lesion suggests the invasion of tumor cells via blood circulation into distal sites , in addition to the facilitating role of mutant p15 in the pulmonary metastasis of osteosarcoma . \\n our results indicate the close correlation between p15 gene mutation and growth of osteosarcoma , and the potentially direct involvement of p15 gene in pulmonary metastasis . \\n our results suggest the potency of p15 mutant genes as a novel biological marker in early diagnosis of osteosarcoma in clinics , although its detailed molecular mechanism in progression and pulmonary metastasis require further study . molecular biology research is still required to elucidate the mechanism of mutation location of p15 gene , as well as its role in the metastasis of osteosarcoma to the lung .', \"the prevalence of syphilis in the normal population has decreased significantly since 1977 in korea ( 1 , 2 ) . however , \\n in western countries the incidence of syphilis has risen , mainly in the 20 - 24 age group and its clinical manifestations have been various ( 3 ) . \\n sexual activity has become more acceptable in our culture recently , initiating various forms of sex , and as a result , many different clinical conditions of sexually transmitted disease ( std ) have appeared . \\n it is usually asymptomatic and less frequently presents as proctitis , ulcer and pseudotumors ( 3 , 4 ) . \\n therefore , it is difficult to diagnose and physicians occasionally might prescribe inappropriate treatments ( 5 , 6 ) . in this paper \\n we describe a case of primary rectal syphilis which was suspected to be rectal cancer . \\n he complained of bowel habit change with tenesmus , mucous discharge , anal pain and intermittent presence of blood in stool . \\n he had a 2 cm sized , firm , non - tender and indurated nodule on the left side of the inguinal area and multiple condyloma acuminatum around the anus . \\n sigmoidoscopy in our gastrointestinal endoscopy unit showed two indurated masses of 1.5 to 2 cm on the posterior wall of the middle and lower rectum ( fig . \\n the masses had a coin like appearance , and each of them had a slightly depressed and ulcerated surface . \\n the vdrl quantitative test was 1:64 and the fta - abs igm and igg test was positive . a human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) \\n the patient was treated with intramuscular penicillin g benzathine ( 2,400,000 iu im/1 week , thrice ) . \\n follow - up sigmoidoscopy after 1 month showed nearly complete regression of the chancre ( fig . \\n a repeat biopsy was done and the histologic result showed focal lymphoid hyperplasia . a vdrl quantitative test after 3 months was 1:1 . \\n most physicians have a tendency to consider rectal ulceration as a neoplasm ( 7 , 8) . similarly in our case symptoms and signs suggested rectal neoplasia and the clinical history did not reveal homosexuality . \\n however , after the vdrl test the patient confessed that he had been raped by a homosexual male . therefore , when rectal syphilis is suspected ( i.e. , perianal condyloma acuminatum associated with inguinal lymphadenopathy ) the history of sexual intercourse , especially rectal intercourse , has to be taken . \\n a dark - field examination is recommended by many studies ( 3 ) . in our case , however , a dark - field examination was not performed , because rectal chancre was highly suggested by the clinical history , anorectal lesions , pathologic findings and positive serologic test . additionally , like other syphilis cases benzathine penicillin therapy induced a rapid regression of the rectal lesions . \\n we believe when a positive serologic syphilis test is associated with ulcerative lesion , additional laboratory tests are not necessary . \\n inguinal lymphadenopathy need not require an initial biopsy when evidence of regional infection is present . usually after antibiotic therapy of at least 4 weeks \\n , most physicians might decide whether a biopsy is necessary . in this case , however , the physician did not have experience recognizing rectal syphilis , so he immediately obtained a biopsy specimen from the inguinal lesion . \\n . in western countries the incidence of rectal syphilis is rising , especially in groups of active homosexual males . \\n bassi et al . emphasized in his case report that endoscopists should keep in mind the rising incidence of syphilis ( 3 ) . \\n therefore an initial physician should encourage his / her patient to inform him / her of the patient 's sexual history .\", 'with the goal of discovering the genes that contribute to the risk of common diseases , numerous susceptibility loci have been identified using linkage analysis . despite replication of many of these linkages in a second sample , \\n some exceptions include tbc1d1 , identified as the gene responsible for the obesity linkage on chromosome 4p15 - 14 , and hoxb13 , identified as the gene responsible for the prostate cancer linkage on chromosome 17q21 - 22 . \\n however , for many other common disease linkage signals , the underlying causal genes and variants await discovery . \\n the expectation that a single gene accounts for a linkage peak may contribute to the difficulty in identifying causal genes . on the contrary \\n attributed a triglyceride linkage on chromosome 7q36 to variants in five genes and christians et al . \\n found that fine - mapping caused a single quantitative trait locus ( qtl ) for body size in mice to resolve first into three qtls , then one of those to split into two . \\n furthermore , the clustering of causal genes may have stymied the multi - group effort to identify type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) genes on chromosome1q ; two strong associations present in populations of european ancestry failed replication and confirmation in other ethnic groups . \\n these examples suggest that abandoned linkage findings might yet reveal susceptibility genes if reappraised while considering the possibility of multiple causal genes . as for other common diseases , \\n the challenge is even greater in african american ( aa ) populations where both prevalence and genetic diversity are higher , and pathophysiology may differ . \\n genome wide case - control association studies ( gwass ) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) with small effects on t2d risk , but few of the associated snps , identified primarily in european ancestry populations , are replicated in aas and few snps have been identified in aa populations . in general , the widespread rejection of family studies in favor of gwass has failed to produce the promised prognostic and diagnostic variants for t2d . as a resource for the discovery of genes related to t2d and its complications , the american diabetes association established the genetics of niddm ( gennid ) study . from 1993 to 2003 \\n we have used this resource to increase understanding of the genetics of t2d by applying linkage and family - based association analysis to the african american ( aa ) subset of the gennid sample . \\n genome - wide linkage analysis using genotypes on 5,914 snps identified chromosomal regions that potentially harbor risk genes for t2d and age of t2d diagnosis ( aod ) . \\n the strongest signal for t2d occurred on chromosome 2 at 95121 megabases ( mb ) , with weaker support for aod in the same region and for t2d at 6895 mb . \\n both t2d and aod also showed linkage on chromosome 13 at 1930 mb , but linkage was limited to t2d on chromosome 7 at 5079 mb and to aod on chromosome 18 at 3165 mb . \\n other analyses inferred pleiotropy with triglyceride in the chromosome 2p region and pleiotropy with obesity in the chromosome 13 region . herein we present linkage and association analyses on the aa subset of the gennid sample using genotypes on 9,203 fine - mapping snps added to the genome scan snps used previously . \\n our first goal was to more precisely localize the t2d susceptibility genes in each of the five chromosomal regions identified in the genome scan ( chromosome 2 at 6895 and 95121 mb , chromosome 7 at 5079 mb , chromosome 13 at 1930 mb , and chromosome 18 at 3165 mb ) . \\n our second goal was to test for association of the gene - based fine - mapping snps with t2d and aod in order to identify genes related to t2d in aas . \\n the gennid study ascertained families through sibling pairs each with a t2d diagnosis . during phase 1 , \\n extended family members were also studied ; one site ascertained aas . during phase 2 , data collection beyond the sibling pair was limited to parents , or , if parents were unavailable , unaffected siblings ; five sites ascertained aas . during phase 3 , only affected sibling pairs and trios were studied ; 5 additional sites ascertained aas . in total , 1,496 aa members of 580 pedigrees were studied at 10 sites . \\n data cleaning and re - evaluation of t2d diagnoses by current criteria reduced the analysis sample to 1,344 members of 524 pedigrees ; for this study , we selected an informative subset of 1,077 members of 415 pedigrees . \\n t2d diagnoses , originally following national diabetes data group criteria , were re - evaluated using current criteria prior to all analyses ; 84 affected and 13 unaffected sample members were re - assigned as unknown . \\n body mass index ( bmi ) was computed from height and weight obtained from physical examination . \\n we selected a subset of the sample for fine - mapping by excluding unaffected individuals below age 53 , the age by which onset had occurred in 75% of cases , and then any individual , either affected or unaffected , who consequently had no family members in the sample . \\n this sample subset maintained significant lod scores in each of the linkage regions and produced power over 80% to detect association . \\n power to produce a p - value of 0.00001 was estimated from simulation of 1000 replicates of a snp with minor allele frequency 0.4 and heterozygous effect a 10% increase in penetrance at age 50 for t2d or 3 year increase in aod . for fine - map genotyping , we used snagger ( http://snagger.sourceforge.net/ ) to select tagsnps within genes in the linkage regions on chromosomes 2 , 7 , 13 , and 18 . using hapmap phase 1 and 2 ( http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ) , \\n variants in the region were tagged at linkage disequilibrium ( ld ) r  0.7 . \\n each snp selected had minor allele frequency > 0.1 and illumina design score > 0.4 ; snp pairs had minimum spacing of 60 base pairs ( bp ) . \\n the genetic map locations of the snps in centimorgans ( cm ) were obtained from the rutgers combined linkage - physical map of the human genome ( http://compgen.rutgers.edu/maps ) ; locations of snps not mapped directly were estimated using physical positions from ncbi dbsnp build 123 in a smoothing calculation ( conway institute bioinformatics service ; http://integrin.ucd.ie ) . \\n genotyping errors were identified using pedcheck and merlin ; we zeroed 4978 genotypes of 710 snps , 74 identified by pedcheck and 4904 by merlin . \\n genotypes for 24 snps , available on less than 95% of the sample following data cleaning , were retained after confirmation of minimal effects on the results . \\n multi - point identity by descent ( ibd ) probabilities were computed at each cm using merlin , treating as haplotypes snp sets with pairwise ld r > 0.7 . \\n we identified 279 , 175 , 133 , and 259 snp sets on chromosomes 2 , 7 , 13 , and 18 , respectively . \\n likelihood analysis , as implemented in jpap , was used for univariate linkage analysis of unadjusted t2d ( ut2d ) , t2d adjusted for bmi ( bt2d ) , and aod and for bivariate association analysis of ut2d and aod . \\n aod was adjusted for gender and modeled as a normal density with mean , standard deviation , and gender effect as parameters . \\n t2d risk was modeled to account for aod in affected pedigree members , while allowing for censored observations with age , gender , and bmi ( for bt2d only ) effects and penetrance as parameters . for each trait , \\n additional parameters included heritability , a quantitative trait locus ( qtl ) effect in linkage analysis , and an additive snp effect in association analysis . \\n we applied variance components linkage analysis using the univariate model for each trait in conjunction with the ibd probabilities . at each cm across the 5 regions , all parameters were estimated for aod while only heritability and qtl effect were estimated for ut2d and bt2d with all other parameters for those traits fixed at estimates obtained upon maximizing the likelihood while correcting the likelihood for the ascertainment of each pedigree through an affected sib pair . \\n the lod score at each cm was computed as the common logarithm of the ratio of the maximized likelihoods with the qtl effect estimated to the maximized likelihood with the qtl effect set to zero . \\n we assessed each fine - mapping snp for association with ut2d and aod by coding the snp genotype as an additive covariate and testing its effect on both traits in a bivariate model . \\n p values were determined using a 2 degree of freedom  statistic computed as twice the natural logarithm of the ratio of the maximized likelihood with covariate effects estimated for both t2d and aod to the maximized likelihood with both effects set equal to zero . \\n we controlled for multiple testing separately within each of the 5 linkage regions by specifying a false discovery rate of 0.05 accounting for 1291 , 1780 , 1819 , 1336 , and 2977 fine - mapping snps for chromosomes 2p , 2q , 7 , 13 , and 18 , respectively . \\n we tested for an independent effect of each secondary associated snp , conditional on the snp within the same gene that attained the highest significance , by comparing the maximized likelihood estimating t2d and aod covariate effects for both snps simultaneously to the maximized likelihood estimating t2d and aod covariate effects for the most significant snp alone . \\n p < 0.05 after bonferroni correction for the number of secondary snps in the gene supported the independence of the secondary snp . \\n we genotyped 9,203 snps within five regions encompassing a total of 133 cm and 128 mb ( table 1 ) and merged them with 244 ( 36 duplicates ) genome scan snps . \\n spacing between snps averaged 0.0145 cm ( 13,910 bp ) and ranged from 0.0 to 5.3 cm and from 26 bp to 6 mb . to comply with the sample size limitations of the cidr genotyping platform , we selected a subset of the original linkage sample to be informative for both linkage and association . \\n the genotyped subset included 1077 members of 415 pedigrees that ranged from 2 to 11 members ( 1 to 8 were genotyped ) . in this subset , \\n aod and bmi differed little from the complete sample , but the unaffected sample members , selected for a minimum age of 53 years , were older ( table 2 ) . \\n we previously identified 5 linkage peaks within four chromosomal regions from autosomal scans of t2d and aod ; the chromosome 2 region contained 2 peaks separated by 30 mb and the centromere . \\n using updated genetic map positions for the genome scan snps , we repeated the linkage analyses on the smaller sample : the genome scan lod scores for all 5 peaks ( table 3 ) generally agreed with our published lod scores for bt2d and aod and for ut2d . upon adding the fine - mapping snps , linkage evidence remained in all 5 regions , but strengthened only on chromosome 2 ( table 3 ) . on chromosome 18 , only aod supported linkage , although ut2d provided weak support ( lod = 2.62 ) upon elimination of sample members with bmi > 45 \\n . the most remarkable effect of fine - mapping was the splitting of the lod score curves into multiple peaks in all of the regions except on chromosome 18 . \\n additional evidence that multiple susceptibility genes contribute to the linkage signals derived from the identification of associated snps that reside in multiple genes within each of the 5 regions , including on chromosome 18 ( table 4 ) . \\n the number of associated snps ranged from 4 on chromosome 13 to 17 on chromosome 2q ; the number of associated genes ranged from 2 on chromosome 13 to 9 on chromosome 7 . \\n although 20 of the 27 associated genes were identified through a single snp , 5 genes were identified through 2 or 3 snps and arhgap25 and dpp10 were identified by 8 and 10 , respectively \\n . however , six associated snp pairs exceeded ld r  0.7 : arhgap25 ( rs6714065 and rs7605681 ) , ctnna2 ( rs968820 and rs1368915 ) , dpp10 ( rs843417 and rs1823267 , rs10204212 and rs13432035 , rs4848376 and rs11694256 ) , and hip1 ( rs1179625 and rs1179622 ) . nevertheless , conditional association analysis supported the independence of two or more snps in arhgap25 , polr1b , dpp10 , and mtus2 ( supplementary table s1 ) . \\n the fine - mapping of five chromosomal regions allowed us not only to confirm our genome scan linkages , but also to infer the presence of multiple t2d susceptibility genes in each of the regions . \\n two types of evidence supported the presence of multiple susceptibility genes underlying the linkage peaks . \\n first , except chromosome 18 , each lod score peak split into at least two peaks when fine - mapping snps were added to the linkage analysis . \\n second , in every region including chromosome 18 , two or more potential susceptibility genes were identified through the association with t2d and aod of fine - mapping snps residing in those genes . \\n in fact , martin et al . attributed many failures to identify causal variants to the incorrect assumption that a single or a limited number of variants are responsible for a linkage signal . \\n as evidence , they identified variants in five genes that fully accounted for a linkage peak for plasma triglyceride level \\n . if small effects are typical of common disease susceptibility genes , their detection through linkage analysis may be limited to locations where the genes cluster . \\n however , fine - mapping using next generation sequencing may provide sufficient power necessary to detect even isolated genes . although chromosome 18 failed to show t2d linkage and chromosome 7 failed to show aod linkage \\n , we nevertheless expect that the susceptibility genes residing in all regions both increase t2d risk and decrease aod . \\n variation between regions in the information available undoubtedly affects the relative strength of the corresponding lod scores for t2d or aod . as evidence , the elimination of t2d cases with bmi > 45 kg / m revealed a weak t2d linkage on chromosome 18 and fine - mapping revealed aod linkages on chromosomes 2p and 2q . \\n the lod scores are generally lower for aod than for t2d as expected since aod reflects onset age imprecisely and the familial correlation of aod may partially result from temporal clustering of t2d diagnoses among relatives . nevertheless , aod proved sufficiently accurate to produce linkage evidence in 4 of the chromosomal regions . \\n few of the associated genes have previously been reported to associate with t2d or related traits . \\n the exceptions include grb10 with t2d , \\n nedd4l with diabetic nephropathy , and lipg with lipid metabolism . \\n novel candidates reported herein include a cytokine ( il36b ) and genes involved in lipid metabolism ( acoxl ) and cell - cell and cell - matrix adhesions ( magi2 , cldn4 , ctnna2 ) . \\n interestingly , the candidates also included genes involved in williams - beuren syndrome ( wbscr28 , wbscr17 , cldn4 ) , whose sufferers have a high prevalence of diabetes and pre - diabetes . \\n dpp10 is related to dpp4 , whose inhibitors are oral anti - hyperglycemics used in t2d therapy , and dpp6 , which contributes to a triglyceride linkage , however , unlike dpp4 , ddp10 lacks serine protease / dipeptidyl peptidase activity . \\n support for the functionality of these genes derived from evidence that their expression levels are affected by our associated snps or proxies with high ld . \\n we tested 14 snps in the 5 genes for which expression levels from transformed lymphocytes were measured on a subset of 160 sample members ; nominal significance was obtained for one : p = 0.0148 for an effect of rs7579103 on arhgap2 expression levels . \\n in other populations and various tissues , expression levels of arhgap2 , aff3 , polr1b , hip1 , lipg , and nedd4l showed evidence of an effect of an associated snp or its proxy ( p<1105 ) . for further insight into the nature of the associations , we haplotyped sets of 1530 fine - mapping snps , each encompassing two or more of the associated snps reported in table 4 . \\n for arhgap25 , two haplotypes associated with t2d : the first extended across 4 of the associated snps and contained the risk alleles for all 4 ; the second extended across 6 associated snps and contained the risk alleles for all 6 , but differed from the first haplotype for alleles at other snps . \\n we propose that each haplotype harbors a distinct causal variant , despite sharing associations with the same risk alleles , demonstrating the complexity of disease associations . \\n the advantages include the opportunity to exploit information on local ancestry to localize disease susceptibility genes . \\n as with any such analysis , confirmation of these findings awaits replication in another sample . in summary , linkage and association analysis using genotypes on an additional 9,203 fine - mapping snps added to five chromosomal regions confirmed each linkage and identified potential susceptibility genes in each of the regions . \\n ', \"dysphagia is the subjective awareness of difficulty in the passage of solids or liquids from the oropharynx to the stomach . \\n dysphagia can be classified into an oropharyngeal or an esophageal location , and it is caused by neuromuscular motility disorders and mechanical obstruction.1 ) mechanical dysphagia is associated with intrinsic or extrinsic compression , resulting in progressive intolerance to solids . the term , dysphagia aortica , has been used to describe difficulty in swallowing caused by external compression from an ectatic , tortuous , or aneurysmal aorta as a result of age - related degeneration.2 ) dysphagia aortica is classically seen in elderly women with short stature who have hypertension and kyphosis.3 ) we report herein a patient with dysphagia associated with an aortic aneurysm . \\n an 86-year - old woman presented with worsening nausea and vomiting . because of her progressive dysphagia to solids for the last 6 months , she had ingested only semisolids and liquids . \\n three days before seeking evaluation at our hospital , she had difficulty in swallowing liquids , along with nausea and vomiting . \\n the medical history revealed that she had been diagnosed with primary hypertension , an ascending aortic aneurysm , congestive heart failure , moderate aortic regurgitation , and moderate mitral regurgitation 6 years previously . because of old age \\n she had undergone vertebroplasty due to multiple compression fractures of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae 5 years ago . on admission to the hospital \\n the blood pressure was 130/90 mmhg , the pulse rate was 64 beats / min , the respiratory rate was 28 breath / min , the body temperature was 36.0 , the height was 1.43 m , and the body weight was 37 kg . \\n the physical examination showed a diastolic murmur at the right upper sternal border and a pansystolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border . \\n the laboratory findings were as follows : the white blood cell ( wbc ) count was 5,100/mm , the hemoglobin was 11.8 g / dl , the platelet count was 151,000/mm , the blood urea nitrogen ( bun ) was 39.8 mg / dl , the creatinine was 1.5 mg / dl , the total protein was 5.8 g / dl , the albumin was 3.2 g / dl , the lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) was 546 \\n her chest radiograph revealed blunting signs at both costophrenic angles , cardiomegaly with a cardio - thoracic ratio of 0.8 , and an enlarged , tortuous aorta ( fig . \\n 1 ) . computed tomography ( ct ) of the chest demonstrated an enlarged , tortuous aorta ( fig . \\n the diameters of the ascending thoracic aorta , the descending thoracic aorta , and the proximal abdominal aorta were 7 cm , 6 cm , and 5.3 cm , respectively . \\n the upper gastrointestinal barium study revealed marked extrinsic compression of the distal esophagus just above the esophagogastric junction ( fig . \\n we concluded that the symptoms and the results of the imaging studies were consistent with dysphagia aortica . \\n although we recommended surgical correction of the aortic aneurysm or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy , the patient declined any invasive procedures and she was transferred to a nursing home on the 12 hospital day . \\n the esophagus normally begins on the right side of the thoracic aorta and then descends . \\n then , the esophagus lies on the left side of the aorta and penetrates the diaphragm through the diaphragmatic histus.4 ) the aging process and the accompanying degenerative changes with the loss of elasticity causes a dilated , elongated , and distorted aorta , which may result in a so - called reverse c- or reverse s - shaped aorta.3 ) as a result , the esophagus is pushed and compressed by the aorta against the cardiac chambers , which are anterior in location.5 ) there is no gold standard diagnostic procedure for dysphagia aortica . \\n the association of suggestive symptoms , such as progressive intolerance to solids with concomitant weight loss along with the results of imaging and other diagnostic studies provide a high index of suspicion.6 ) the diagnostic work - up includes radiologic , endoscopic , and manometric studies . on a standard chest radiography and ct scan , the enlargement of the aortic arch and the tortuous dilated aorta can be observed . \\n a barium swallow test may show partial esophageal obstruction and pulsatile movement of the barium synchronous with aortic pulsation.7 ) endoscopy reveals pulsatile extrinsic compression and stenosis of the lower esophagus with proximal dilatation . \\n esophageal manometry may demonstrate a localized high pressure band with superimposed pounding that is synchronous with the cardiac pulsation.8 ) however , the typical findings of dysphagia aortica can be inconsistent . \\n the radiographic findings are often inconclusive because a dilated , tortuous thoracic aorta is frequently encountered in elderly patients with dysphagia . \\n although a ct scan is useful for evaluating not only the aortic lumen , but also the aortic wall,9 ) occasionally this is of no value in assessing compression of the esophagus by the aorta.2 ) false negative results are common for barium swallow studies . \\n in addition , the classical manometric features suggestive of dysphagia aortica also occur in normal subjects.8 ) the differential diagnosis of dysphagia aortica includes various common structural and neuromuscular abnormalities.1 ) gastroesophageal reflux disease and motility disorders are common causes of dysphagia . \\n the co - existence of these conditions and the lack of sensitivity and specificity of the usual diagnostic tests make it difficult to diagnose dysphagia aortica with certainty . \\n wilkinson et al.2 ) demonstrated that a video solid bolus swallow test could be useful in determining the manometric findings that are suspicious for dysphagia aortica when the standard evaluation fails . \\n mild cases may be treated conservatively , such as avoiding sticky solids and feeding on a liquid diet . \\n the surgical procedures include transposition of the distal esophagus , separation of the distal esophagus from the aorta , esophagomyotomy , division of the right crus of the diaphragm , aortic resection , and repair of an aneurysm . for patients who are not candidates for surgery , insertion of a feeding tube via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( peg ) \\n although we did not perform esophageal manometry , the patient 's symptoms and imaging studies were consistent with the classic findings of dysphagia aortica . \\n although the patient declined any invasive procedures , a peg for a feeding tube might have been helpful for nutritional support . \\n dysphagia aortica is an uncommon type of dysphagia that is caused by extrinsic mechanical compression . \\n it should be differentiated from other causes of dysphagia , such as gastroesophageal reflux disease or motility disorders , because dysphagia aortica often requires surgical intervention that can significantly reduce the morbidity and these interventions can be curative in some situations .\", 'from now on , molecular study regarding female sexuality has focused on female sexual hormone , like estrogen receptor ( er ) and er derivatives.12 but flibanserin is an agent of 5-hydroxytryptamin ( 5-ht ) type 1a receptor and an antagonist of 5-ht type 2a and thus a new molecular entity.3 flibanserin was originally developed as antidepressant drug . in clinical stage 2a as antidepressant , flibanserin could not prove its effectiveness , but almost no sexual function disorder was reported in subjects . for this reason , the arizona sexual experiences scale ( asex ) was used for making a comparison of the sexual function effectiveness of flibanserin on antidepressant vs. placebo proven in stage 2b studies among four depression programs.4 stage 2b studies have failed to prove its general effectiveness on depression , but in answering this question \" how intense is your sexual desire ? \" in the asex , flibanserin turned out to be more excellent in both placebo and active - comparator . \\n since then , drug development has changed its directivity toward being a potential medicine for treating hypoactive sexual desire disorder ( hsdd ) . \\n hsdd is chara or absence of sexual fantasy and sexual desire associated with personal pain in the 4th edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual - text revision ( dsm - iv - tr).5 determining lack or absence is done by clinicians by considering the factors influencing sexual activitie such as age and contexts of personal life . \\n sexual function disorder is not explained well by other axis 1 disorders ( except other sexual function disorders ) and also it is not that it is caused only by direct physiological effects of materials ( i.e. , drug overuse , drug ) or overall medical status . \\n the dsm-5 completed in 2013 addresses new illness called as female sexual interest / arousal disorder ( fsiad ) , which has both properties of hsdd and another illness of dsm - iv known as female sexual arousal disorder . \\n flibanserin underwent new drug application ( nda ) as original drug in 2009 . the two central phase 3 studies ( violet6 , daisy7 ) all used e - diary and did not show big statistical improvement compared to placebo in the pre - specified co - primary efficacy endpoint that assessed daily sexual desire . in both violet6 and daisy7 studies , flibanserin showed an increase in satisfying sexual events ( sse ) and female sexual function index ( fsfi ) and reduction in female sexual distress scale - revised ( fsds - r ) , but did not show a meaningful increase in e - diary scores compared to placebo . in both studies , \\n the most commonly reported adverse effects in women prescribed with flibanserin include drowsiness ( 11.8% ) , vertigo ( 10.5% ) , and fatigue ( 10.3%).67 these studies show a statistically significant improvement in secondary end points that measured sexual desire with other tools known as fsfi compared to placebo . \\n applicants told that the effectiveness of flibanserin against sexual desire is better explained with fsfi , but most advisory committees did not agree to alteration in the e - diary evaluation method set as the one designed to evaluate sexual desire . \\n the safety consciousness expressed by the advisory committees includes adverse effects such as fatigue and drowsiness as well as drug - drug interactions ( ddis ) and flibanserinalcohol interactions . \\n another central stage 3 study is begonia,8 which set sse , fsfi , fsds - r as major evaluation methods rather than using e - diary in the existing viole and daisy studies and reported that flibanserin shows a statistically significant increase in sse and fsfi and reduction in fsds - r compared to placebo . \\n however , many problems with safety were brought up in the second submission , too . \\n vertigo , drowsiness , and vomiting are the most commonly reported adverse effects , and these occurred 2% to 3% , respectively if using placebo during stage 3 placebo - control premenopausal hsdd , whereas occurred close to 11% in subjects who used flibanserin as 100 mg every night at bedtime . \\n events matching central nervous system depression ( fatigue , drowsiness , and vertigo ) occurred close to 21% in subjects who used flibanserin as 100 mg every night at bedtime and this proportion is three times higher than in placebo group . \\n flibanserin is very difficult to endure if taking in combination with fluconazole and strong cytochrome p450 3a4 ( cyp3a4 ) suppressant and this combination may increase the risk of swoon and symptomatic low blood pressure . and \\n ethanol administered in combination with flibanserin greatly increases the risk of drowsiness , fatigue , orthostatic hypotension , and swoon . \\n additionally , these studies were limited to general healthy women who did not take benzodiazepines , sleep aid , narcotics and many other drugs . \\n the effectiveness was not so big in general , and considering these concerns , fda refused to approve it again and recommended that additional safety studies are required . according to the latest fda review , there is no data indicating new efficacy . instead , flibanserin sponsors submitted additional safety data next day including research data proving that there is no obstacle to driving , data comparing the commercialized products and the side effects profile of these products , and analysis clarifying the potential effects of alcohol on side effects.9 despite the trustfulness of highly influential studies , fda product review is not a fundamental comparison , in fact , and so comparison of safety between individual products may be misunderstood . in particular , \\n alcohol interaction study was conducted in 25 healthy volunteers as a sample , among which only two were female . \\n since the refusal from fda in 2013 , a civic group called as even the score was formed to support what was called as \" gender equality \" in the manner approaching sexual function disorder treatment.10 this group insisted that there is no treatment for women although even 26 items for male sexual function disorder were already approved . \\n this argument was rejected by fda on the ground that there are no approved products for low sexual desire in men and the 26 items for treatment contain various mixtures of testosterone . despite the fact that flibanserin is supported by consumer advocacy groups and consequently not the first product supported by pharmaceutical companies , fda \\'s argument on gender bias while regulating is worthy of notice in that the range of making efforts against this argument is from campaigns via social media even to letters from the members of the national assembly.11 another noteworthy feature in application for flibanserin to fda is use of the findings on sexual desire reported by patients as primary efficacy variable for approval . \\n sexual desire can be seen by those who experience it and the results reported by patients can be measured without confounding this concept from others . \\n the results reported by patients have become more important in studies and other drugs that have such results as primary end point have been approved ( although none were based on sexual desire ) . among all new molecular entities and biological permit applications approved by fda from 2006 to 2010 , \\n gnanasakthy et al.12 found that among which , 17% ( 20 in 116 ) used the results reported by acknowledged patients as primary outcome in approval labels . \\n the complex element in evaluating flibanserin lies in recalling the frequency of desire and extent of intensity and then measuring with fsfi index four weeks after the daily records of the most intense desires when applying for the primary desire end point first time . \\n fda raised some concerns about optimizing fsfi as desire assessment tool , including the validity of contents and the period of recall , but the recent advisory committees did not focus on changing the primary end points or consulting the validity of fsfi . \\n the final concern with flibanserin is associated with its use in clinical settings and this was an important issue for the committees . despite little reliable estimate of hsdd prevalence \\n , this product will be used obviously in women in a broader sense than had been studied so far like others , many will not satisfy the official diagnostic criteria of hsdd , and many will increase the risk of adverse effects or be administering other drugs . \\n the concerns with its use without labeling were reemphasized again by speakers who argued that they need flibanserin , but at the same time , it was reported that those who were diagnosed with cancer or in menopause should be excluded from treatment with flibanserin by labeling when sold . \\n on june 4 , 2015 , fda called a committee meeting to review the efficacy and safety of flibanserin , and after the meeting , the committee approved flibanserin under the condition that risk management tools should be enforced mandatorily . despite the presence of many problems with flibanserin , \\n fda finally approved it under the condition that risk evaluation and mitigation strategies ( rems ) should be enforced for flibanserin . in the future \\n , flibanserin is expected to gradually increase in amount with changes from off - label to on - label . \\n if prescription with flibanserin is determined as necessary , before using it , it is important to check prescription criterion , possible adverse effects after prescription , and precautions during administration . to get a prescription with flibanserin , \\n the first criteria is premenopausal women aged 18 year or more who met the stages of reproductive aging workshop ( straw ) criteria . \\n the straw criteria are that she has a regular menstrual cycle for 21 to 35 days in the previous twelve months and a normal level of follicle stimulating hormone ( fsh ) . \\n in addition , it should be prescribed if primary diagnosis is hsdd according to dsm - iv - tr criteria or if there is any secondary sexual arousal disorder or female disposition disorder accompanied by hsdd . besides , its prescription is likely to be considered if the fsds - r ( range , 0 - 52 ) score13 used in clinical studies is 15 points or higher . in addition , in case that sexual desire disorder comes from disease , psychiatric problems , and interpersonal problems or in case that it does so from medications or other substances taken in conjunction , these cases are not the diseases for which medicine is efficacious . besides , \\n postmenopausal women and sexual desire decline disorder male patients are not adapted during use and i t is not intended for reinforcing sexuality.1415 \\n the adverse effects most common in prescribing flibanserin are reported as vertigo , fatigue , vomiting , insomnia , and mouth dryness . \\n precautions in prescription include avoiding the use of other substances associated with cyp3a4 and cytochrome p450 2c19 ( cyp2c19 ) which are associated with drug metabolism , for example , administration with ketoconazole as cyp3a4 inhibitor and grapefruit juice and fluconazole as cyp3a4 or cyp2c19 inhibitor , which are likely to increase the risk of orthostatic hypotension side effects . \\n furthermore , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( ssri / snri ) may cause anxiety , drowsiness , fatigue , insomnia , and vertigo , if used . so carefulness is required . \\n alcohol is contraindication because if administered with alcohol , it is highly likely to cause central nervous system depression ( fatigue , drowsiness , and vertigo ) , low blood pressure , and swoon . \\n hormonal contraceptives are known as weak cyp3a4 inhibitors , and likely to cause side effects such as vertigo , drowsiness , and fatigue if coadministered with flibanserin . \\n triptans is used for treating migraine as agonist of 5-ht type 1b and 1d receptor and may cause side effects of drowsiness if administered with flibanserin . \\n in addition , if flibanserin is administered to patients with decline in liver failure , increase in concentration of drug in blood is observed and thus it \\'s considered that adverse effects are likely to occur . besides , taking it with herb extracts and digesters and gastroprotective drugs requiring no doctor prescription is likely to cause the risk of adverse effects and the use of flibanserin to women who are breast - feeding is contraindication . \\n as we discussed above , flibanserin was refused to approve by fda in 2009 for its adverse effects and discordance of its efficacy from different evaluation methods . \\n most common side effects were central nervous system depression , like fatigue , drowsiness , and vertigo . \\n ddis with fluconazole , ethanol , and many other drugs were mainly discussed and fda refused to approve it again recommending additional safety data . with the additional profile and analysis which can prove their safety compared with other products , \\n on june 4 , 2015 , fda finally approved it on the grounds that rems should be enforced , and soon we can get flibanserin on - label under the strict prescription . \\n flibanserin can be prescribed to premenopausal women aged 18 years or higher who has a regular menstrual cycle , but if liver function fails , if breast - feeding , and if drinking alcohol , the use of flibanserin is contraindication . \\n also , its administration with fluconazole , ketoconazole , ssri / snri , triptans , hormonal contraceptives , herb extracts , and several other drugs requiring no doctor prescription is prohibited because it is likely to increase the risk of adverse effects . \\n we are waiting for patients \\' reaction , considering the cost and effectiveness , in countries where flibanserin will be on sale , and more agents like unicenta ( uncnt ) and melsmon , which proved as having a efficacy of menopausal symptoms , have to be studied as treating for female sexual dysfunction.16', 'kcm is itself very rare and distinct type of keratoacanthoma which usually occurs over extremities and scalp is unusual site for development of lesion . \\n treatment is difficult as lesion of kcm present with large raised , rolled borders with peripheral extension . \\n keratoacanthoma ( ka ) is a rapidly evolving tumor , composed of keratinizing squamous cells originating in pilosebaceous follicles and resolving spontaneously if left untreated . \\n it is relatively common , especially in whites occurring in middle age while being uncommon in dark - skinned . \\n . it presents as firm , rounded , flesh - colored or reddish papule ; with a rapid growth phase becoming 10 - 20 mm and then spontaneous healing taking place over three months . \\n there are three rare clinical variants of solitary ka , namely giant ka , keratoacanthoma centrifugum marginatum ( kcm ) and subungual ka . in kcm , lesions are large , reaching upto 20 cms . \\n the most common locations are dorsa of hands and legs , lesions on scalp being rare . \\n we report a rare case of kcm occurring on the scalp which is an unusual site . \\n a 62-year - old male , watchman by occupation presented with asymptomatic raised lesion on scalp since one year . \\n lesion had developed de novo , as a pea sized lesion with gradual increase to cover entire vertex . \\n cutaneous examination revealed a single , irregular , 12  15 cm , yellowish plaque on vertex of scalp with nodular surface and a central crater [ figure 1 ] . on palpation , the plaque was firm , non - tender , non - indurated and not attached to underlying structure . \\n ultrasonography of lesion showed ill defined hypo echoic mass involving epidermis , dermis and subcutaneous tissue . \\n a single , irregular , 12  15 cm , yellowish plaque on vertex of scalp with nodular surface and a central crater . \\n deep punch biopsy revealed exoendophytic , globular , well circumscribed central cup shaped crater , epidermal invagination with marked hyperkeratosis and horn cyst with rich keratin filled crater imparting glassy appearance and well demarcated regular base . \\n . marked epidermal proliferation with crater formation with horn pearls and inflammatory infiltrate at the base of the lesion was suggestive of a fully developed lesion of kcm . \\n complete surgical excision with grafting was done successfully with dramatic improvement with no recurrence at 9 months [ figure 5 ] . \\n exoendophytic , globular , well circumscribed central cup shaped crater , epidermal invagination with marked hyperkeratosis and horn cyst with rich keratin filled crater imparting glassy appearance and well demarcated regular base epidermis forming buttress over the pseudhorn cyst

chemical carcinogens like pitch , mineral oil , tar , trauma and vaccination . \\n the role of human papilloma virus remains inconclusive but in one study , hpv type 6 and 11 were detected within the lesion . \\n it can be localized to any region of the body but is more frequently seen on dorsum of hands and legs . \\n progressive peripheral extension with a raised rolled - out margin and atrophy at the centre is a characteristic feature of kcm . \\n the margin of the lesion showing multiple comedonal orifices giving rise to a cribriform pattern may represent a unique phenomenon of kcm . \\n it is hypothesized that this typical appearance may arise as a result of sequential involvement of multiple adjacent hair follicles in a centrifugal fashion . \\n kcm does not show tendency for spontaneous regression , a feature also seen in giant ka , which grows rapidly reaching a size of 5 cm or more and occurring commonly on nose and eyelids . \\n kcm is differentiated from giant ka by absence of downward vertical spread and destruction of underlying tissue . \\n nevertheless , in giant ka spontaneous involution takes place after several months , often accompanied by detachment of a large keratotic plaque . \\n the other differential diagnoses include squamous cell carcinoma , lupus vulgaris , botryomycosis , blastomycosis - like pyoderma and pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia , hypertrophic lupus erythematosus , atypical mycobacterial infections , or deep fungal infections . \\n there are reports that kcm has been treated successfully with oral retinoids ( acitretin , etretinate , or isotretinoin 0.5 - 1 mg / kg / day ) which should be given until complete clearance of lesion . \\n surgical intervention is a preferred mode of therapy keeping in mind that a wide excision is performed to prevent subsequent recurrence . \\n other treatment modalities successfully used include topical 5-fluorouracil , intralesional injections of interferon alpha , methotrexate , or bleomycin , or mohs micrographic surgery . in kcm , lesions are usually too large for excisional biopsy for diagnosis , but certain characteristic features like clinical behavior , appearance of lesions , histological features ( hyperkeratosis and hyperplasia ) , and cytological features ( tumor cells with eosinophilic and glassy cytoplasm , few mitoses ) help clinch the correct diagnosis . \\n first time from india we are reporting case of kcm presenting over scalp which is successfully treated with surgical excision without any recurrence .', \"hydroxyapatite biomaterials are materials

. \\n this value is of course even more if the crab 's consumptions in the country are also taken into account . \\n this suggests the existence of crab shells is abundant in indonesia , including in makassar . \\n as known in indonesia , the shells of crabs have not been used , so it will only be a waste disturbing environment [ 7 , 8 ] . \\n crabs shells containing calcium carbonate ( caco3 ) are very abundant ; amount 4070% , varies according to the species . \\n calcium carbonate can be further processed into calcium hydroxyapatite [ ca10(po4)6(oh)2 ] [ 4 , 5 ] . according to strassler , \\n hydroxyapatite is one of the active ingredient materials that are widely used in toothpaste products for protection against teeth demineralization [ 1113 ] . \\n the crystals structure of hydroxyapatite will be better by using cao as a precursor of calcium . \\n however , the use of these compounds also produces carbonate apatite [ ca10(po4)6co3 ] in a fairly large percentage . \\n this is because the calcination process can not completely eliminate carbon dioxide ( co2 ) in caco3 so that there can be reaction with the precursor phosphate . \\n however , the carbonate apatite heating at a temperature of 700900c for 25 hours , followed by washing using distilled water , the carbonate apatite can be hydroxyapatite [ 1113 ] . the instrument were used in this research were glass apparatus , ohaus analytical balance , petri dish , porcelain cup , buchner flask , buchner funnel , vacuum pump sargent - welch co. model 1400 , magnetic stirrer , magnetic bar , hotplate

shimadzu , fourier transform infra - red ( ftir ) prestige-21 shimadzu , scanning electron microscopy combined with the ability to generate localized chemical information ( sem - edxa ) variant , and uv - vis shimadzu model 6105 . \\n this is because the carbonate ion compounds are able to inhibit the crystallization process ca10(po4)6(oh)2 so that the results will be dominated by an amorphous phase . \\n if the caco3 burned at temperature calcinations , decomposition reaction of caco3 into cao will occur and co2 emissions are dominant and will be issued as a result of the combustion reaction [ 1315 ] . \\n waste of crabs shells portunus pelagicus species was taken from an exporter crabs company in industry areal , makassar city , south sulawesi province , indonesia . \\n wahidin hospital , and ( nh4)2hpo4 was obtained from fluka chemical , ch3cooh glacial 100% , ch3coona3h2o from merck , ( nh4)6mo7o244h2o from aldrich , nh4vo3 from aldrich , hno3 and naf from fluka chem . , (

portunus pelagicus waste was cleaned with distilled water and dried at room temperature . furthermore , to transform crabs shells into caco3 and then into cao , calcinations were performed on the samples at 1000c temperature for 5 hours at a rate of temperature rise 5c / minute . \\n calcium oxide ( cao ) obtaining dominated as result of calcinations and then made suspensions in 100  ml of distilled water with a calcium concentration of 0.3  m. the suspensions reacted by dropwise with a 100  ml 0.2  m of ( nh4)2hpo4 solution through the coprecipitation method , at temperatures around 40c while the solution was stirred for 25 hours . \\n the precipitation allowed stand overnight or 24 hours at room temperature , and the precipitate is filtered with a whatman filter paper number 40 and dried at 110c for 5 hours . \\n the pure hydroxyapatite obtained by sintering to the dried precipitate at various temperatures of 500900c for 4 hours [ 16 , 17 ] . \\n the characterization of the compounds was performed by using x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) , ftir , and sem - edxa . \\n the proven in vitro demineralization of teeth was conducted through evaluating the concentration of phosphate in solution by using the uv - vis spectroscopy . \\n the effectiveness of hydroxyapatite to protection against teeth demineralization was tested in acetate buffer ph 5.0 solutions , with 1 m of acetic acid concentration with the addition of hydroxyapatite in varying concentrations and immersion time . \\n each of 5 beakers was filled with 300  ml of acetate buffer ph 5.0 with acetic acid concentration of 1  m. an acetate buffer was left without adding anything as a comparison . \\n an acetate buffer was then added 10  ppm of naf left without addition of ca10(po4)6(oh)2 . \\n other three pieces beaker of acetate buffer containing 10  ppm of naf are adding of ca10(po4)6(oh)2 with variation concentration of 25  ppm , 50  ppm , and 100  ppm . \\n the immersed times of tooth samples in solution are 3 , 6 , 9 , 24 , and 48 hours , respectively . \\n furthermore , the phosphate concentration in each solution was measured by using uv - vis spectrophotometer with the wavelength for phosphate ( maks ) being 432  nm . \\n the calcinations aim to eliminate the organic component in the shells of crabs and convert caco3 compound which is the dominant compound in the shells of crabs into cao through the elimination of co2 in gas form . characterizing the calcinations results \\n the results can be seen from the diffraction pattern of the crab shells before and after calcinations at a temperature of 1000c for 5 hours ( figure 1 ) . in this figure \\n can be observed changes in the diffraction pattern of crab shells , where the change in the diffraction pattern is due to the chemical change from mixture of caco3 with organic matter to pure cao . \\n the appearance of the sharper peaks in figure 1 after calcinations ( b ) is a result of the crystallinity of the cao . \\n identification by ft - ir as shown in figure 2 showed there is a reduction process of -co3 groups and some of ir - spectra were missing after calcinations . \\n the elimination of -co3 groups and organic components can also be seen from the data of mass reduction of sample calcinations . \\n the determinations of calcium contained in sample was conducted by using x - ray fluorescence , where obtained calcium is 66.62% after calcinations . \\n these results are then used to calculate the stoichiometry in determining the number of results calcinations which is needed to react with ( nh4)2hpo4 as the precursor phosphate . \\n the precipitation reactions aiming to produce ca10(po4)6(oh)2 used phosphate , ( nh4)2hpo4 , as the precursor and then reacted with cao as calcinations results . \\n side results ca10(po4)6co3 also occur as a product of reaction of ( nh4)2hpo4 and caco3 presence in the calcinations results . \\n dried precipitate further sintered on temperature variations of 4001000c for 2 hours ; it is intended to determine the optimum temperature where the ca10(po4)6(oh)2 is formed , furthermore characterized by using xrd , ft - ir , and sem - edxa . \\n the diffractograms of each sintering results compounds indicate that the temperature is closely related to the formation of crystals . \\n this is due to the nature of the vibrating atoms moving faster in higher temperatures . \\n the optimum temperature formation of hydroxyapatite was determined by calculation of the probability of the sample phase from the xrd results analysis according to jcpds standard data , which , jcpds ; 24 - 0033 is standard data for ca10(po4)6(oh)2 ; 09 - 0169 for -ca3(po4)2 ; 29 - 0359 for -ca3(po4)2 , 35 - 0180 -ca3(po4)2 ; 35 - 0180 for ca10(po4)6co3(oh)2 and 19 - 0272 standard data for ca10(po4)6co3(oh)2 . \\n figures 3 and 4 showed that the temperature is closely associated with the formation of hydroxyapatite phase . in the both graphs it can be seen that the maximum intensity of the phase formation of hydroxyapatite has been found by sintering at temperature of 800c , it means the optimum temperature of hydroxyapatite formation is 800c , and then this result will be used for another application . the formations of hydroxyapatite phase had been dominated at 800c confirmed by percentage probability sample phase ( figure 5 ) , in which the percentage of hydroxyapatite phase formed around 46.61% , while phases of -ca3(po4)2 and phase -ca3(po4)2 are 17.76% and 19.37% , respectively . \\n however , also there is still presence of a phase ca10(po4)6co3 and ca10(po4)6co3(oh)2 with a range of 11.84% and 4.43% , respectively , which indicates the presence of carbonates . \\n the x - ray diffractograms of ca10(po4)6(oh)2 synthesized at a 800c temperature sintering can be seen in figure 6 , where the peaks of ha are symbolized by the peak of the crystal ca10(po4)6(oh)2 , while peak -tkf is symbolized crystalline peaks of -ca3(po4)2 , the symbol -tkf for crystalline -ca3(po4)2 , aka for ca10(po4)6co3 , and akb for ca10(po4)6co3(oh)2 . \\n the highest intensity peak at 31.2572  deg corresponding to crystalline -ca3(po4)2 is seen , the second highest peak intensity is 31.7783 , and the third highest peak intensity is 28.0565 crystals suitable for ca10(po4)6(oh)2 . \\n ftir results showed that the sintering temperature variation affects the absorption band shapes which generally all sintering results showed absorption band of -oh , absorption band 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 of po4 , and co3 groups . \\n infrared spectra in figure 7 show the -oh groups at 633  cm which are characteristic of hydroxyapatite   appearing on the sintering temperatures of 4001000c . \\n additionally spectrum also showed higher sintering temperature causing the sharper peaks phosphate group ( po4 ) because the nature of the vibrating atoms moves faster at higher temperatures . \\n the ft - ir spectra of sample were sintered at a temperature of 800c ( figure 8) showing that hydroxyapatite is the dominant compound formed . \\n the stretching frequencies of po4 group are indicated by 1120.64  cm , 1091.71  cm , 1043.49  cm ( 3 ) , 993.34  cm , 877.61  cm ( 1 ) , 603.72  cm , 565.14  cm , ( 4 ) , and 370.33  cm ( 2 ) . and \\n a sharp spectrum in the area of 3570.24  cm indicates the presence of free -oh and 3427.51  cm indicating -oh bounded , and this is indicating that the dominant compound is ca10(po4)6(oh)2 . while area of 1654.92  cm , 1458.18  cm , and 1421.54  cm indicates the presence of carbonate groups ( co3 ) it can be identified as ca10(po4)6co3 and ca10(po4)6co3(oh)2 which has not been transformed into ca10(po4)6(oh)2 during the sintering process . \\n the results of characterization by sem - edxa shown in figure 9(a ) show that the size of hydroxyapatite formed from the synthesis tends to be small and only a few are large . \\n while figure 9(b ) shows that the surface of hydroxyapatite is smooth and nonporous , this shows that hydroxyapatite which has synthesis from crab shells can function well as inhibiting tooth demineralization . while in figure 10 the edxa spectrum shows the composition of the synthesis yield \\n was dominated by oxygen ( o ) up to 59.52% , calcium ( ca ) up to 23.76% , and phosphorus ( p ) up to 13.32% . \\n demineralization of teeth is a process of decomposition of the crystal of ca10(po4)6(oh)2 due to the acidic conditions by releasing ca and po4 ions . \\n demineralization of tooth causing increased levels of ca and po4 in saliva in direct contact with the tooth . in vitro \\n , the rate of tooth demineralization can be observed through the concentrations of ca and po4 ions in solutions where the tooth was soaked each unit of time . \\n therefore , increase of po4 ions concentrations in solution a soaked gear can be one of indicators to measure the rate of tooth demineralization . \\n figure 11 shows the relationship between the soaking time of teeth versus the increase of the ion po4 levels in solution where the tooth was soaked as well ; it appears that with the increasing addition of ca10(po4)6(oh)2 into the acetate buffer equals to the rate of demineralization decrease . \\n it is can be altered by the amount of po4 ions in solutions ; however the addition of ca10(po4)6(oh)2 ions showed lower amount of po4 ions compared to solutions without the addition of ca10(po4)6(oh)2 . \\n this proves that the ca10(po4)6(oh)2 were synthesized from the crab shell effective for protection against tooth demineralization . \\n the decrease in the rate of tooth demineralization with the addition of ca10(po4)6(oh)2 can also be observed through analyzing the tooth mass reduction in the fifth variation of acetate buffer solution as shown in table 1 \\n . the greater concentrations of ca10(po4)6(oh)2 in the acetate buffer solution were teeth immersed exhibit the smaller mass of teeth in the solution . \\n based on these results it is concluded as follows.waste of shells crabs ( portunus pelagicus ) proved to be used as raw material for the synthesis of ca10(po4)6(oh)2 due to high calcium levels which amounted to 66.62% in addition to the abundant existence as waste.the optimum temperature formation of ca10(po4)6(oh)2 is at 800c.ca10(po4)6(oh)2 were synthesized from waste of shell crabs ( portunus pelagicus ) in vitro effectively inhibiting the rate of demineralization of the tooth where the greater the addition of ca10(po4)6(oh)2 in the solution , the more the inhibiting demineralization of the tooth or the smaller the rate of tooth demineralization in solution . \\n waste of shells crabs ( portunus pelagicus ) proved to be used as raw material for the synthesis of ca10(po4)6(oh)2 due to high calcium

cognitive evaluation and interventions for patients with brain injury . \\n studies using vr \\n programs for cognitive intervention were reviewed according to pico ( patient , intervention , \\n

scale \\n in this review , the types of vr programs that have been used in cognitive evaluations of \\n patients with brain injury were identified and studies of cognitive interventions were \\n reviewed according to pico methods . in the included studies , the vr programs could \\n distinguish the cognitive disability of patients in comparisons with healthy subjects . \\n thus , \\n vr could be used as a new assessment method of the cognitive function of patients with brain \\n injury . \\n therefore , in contrast to conventional cognitive \\n assessments , vr programs can provide consistently accurate measurements of cognitive \\n function . \\n however , some methodological problems were found in the reviewed articles . in most \\n of the studies , \\n the vr tool used was not compared with a standardized assessment tool , and \\n the inter - rater reliability was not measured . \\n the five studies of cognitive therapy using vr all reported positive effects . in the \\n assessment of cognitive function \\n , the vr interventions resulted in improvements in the areas \\n of memory and attention but not executive function . \\n ben - yishay et al.29 stated that to effectively raise cognitive function , \\n normal attention is needed . \\n if the ability to concentrate on external information is \\n impaired , memory , problem - solving skills , and appropriate behavior may be difficult . \\n thus , \\n they suggested that the impairment of attention due to brain injury may interfere with the \\n recovery of other cognitive functions , such as memory , executive function , and planning . \\n the \\n results of this systematic review indicate that the cognitive improvement of attention using \\n vr programs will have a positive impact on the recovery of general cognitive function . \\n the \\n advantage of cognitive rehabilitation using vr is that it provides a variety of environments \\n similar to those encountered in real life30 . \\n the results of this review suggest that patients are more \\n motivated in virtual environments than they are in conventional settings . \\n therefore , vr \\n programs can be expected to lead to an improvement in cognitive function . in vr \\n interventions \\n , patients can be treated in a safe environment compared to real settings . in \\n addition \\n , vr programs can be tailored to the type of injury and easily adjusted to the level \\n of cognitive disability , the complexity of a task , the reaction conditions , and the \\n characteristics and patterns of feedback30 . \\n as vr systems are constantly evolving and becoming smaller and \\n more easily adjustable , they can be expected to provide specialized therapy in new settings , \\n such as patients homes or clinics . \\n these advantages of vr systems can benefit patients who \\n find it difficult to visit health care organizations5 . \\n the results of this systematic review suggest that vr is an effective cognitive therapy for \\n patients with brain injury compared to control therapy . \\n , there was a \\n significant risk of bias with regard to allocation concealment and blinding . \\n given the \\n heterogeneity of the included studies , the ability to draw conclusions is limited . \\n well - designed rcts and blind studies will be needed to provide evidence of the benefits of \\n vr on cognitive function .', 'despite a considerable progress in malaria control in iran over the past few years that led to significant reduction of cases , the disease still remains a major health problem in south and southeastern parts of the country . \\n 2008 , afsharpad et al . 2012 ) and insecticide resistance of anopheles vectors ( enayati et al . \\n 2012 ) are aggravated by continuous influx of imported cases , mostly with plasmodium falciparum , from neighboring countries of afghanistan and pakistan ( zakeri et al . \\n the latest checklists of iranian mosquitoes include 28 anopheles species , identified mostly on the basis of morphological features , and a few by dna - based approaches ( azari - hamidian 2007 ) . \\n maculipennis are known to be responsible for transmission of malaria in the country ( manouchehri et al . \\n some important malaria vectors in iran are assumed to be members of species complexes or species groups , which are often difficult to distinguish morphologically . \\n application of dna - based approaches has resolved some cryptic species in iranian complex species including an . \\n fluviatilis , however , the identity of some members are still doubtful or were refuted later ( azari - hamidian 2007 , naddaf et al . \\n this , to great extent , is due to introduction of molecular markers such as its2 and 28s - d3 genes for discriminating the members of this complex species in india ( manonmani et al . \\n biology , variation in behaviors , and role of this species in malaria transmission in different geographical areas of iran has been extensively reviewed by others ( eshghi et al . \\n 1976 , edalat 19971998 , hanafi - bojd et al . 2012 ) . in an early study comparison of its2 sequence of iranian specimens from

cases reported to develop serious complications and , if there was malignancy , to cause metastasis or recurrence . \\n we presented a case of schwannoma originating from the great omentum , including histological and immunohistological studies . \\n a 55-year - old man was referred to our department for the treatment of a tumor detected close to the stomach by ultrasound . medical examination including \\n ultrasound had been regularly performed to follow up his gallbladder stone for the past 6 years . \\n although he had no complaints and symptoms , the tumor had been increasing in size over one year . \\n abdominal and endoscopic ultrasound showed a 2.0  1.3 cm cystic mass lateral to the wall of the stomach . \\n its component included an 11.8  5.7 mm elevated lesion ( fig . 1 , fig \\n computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a 2.6  1.9 cm cystic mass , which was slightly enhanced , and a gallbladder stone ( fig . \\n 3 ) . magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a hyperintense mass on t2-weighted image . a distance from the stomach wall \\n laboratory tests , including tumor makers , were normal . under a perioperative diagnosis of cystic tumor in the abdomen and cholelithiasis \\n , we performed laparoscopic resection with vessel sealing system , which revealed a 2.0 cm mass arising from the great omentum , not adherent to other organs . \\n grossly , the tumor was configured by a well - encapsulated round mass measuring 30  18  15 mm in diameter ( fig . \\n histologically , the spindle - shaped cells were arranged in interlacing bundles and fascicles , together with varying numbers of tumor cells containing various amounts of light brown or grayish pigment ( fig . \\n these alternate with looser antoni b tissue , which is comprised of cells showing clear , vacuolated cytoplasm due to lipid accumulation . \\n immunohistochemically , most of the neoplastic cells reacted moderately to nse , ncam and s-100 protein ( fig . \\n schwannomas are classified as one kind of the peripheral nerve sheath tumors , of which schwannnoma and neurofibroma are the most frequent . currently , the most precise determination of the tumor 's cell type is established by its immunohistochemical profile , ultrastructural features , or both . a tumor composed of cells with distinctly schwannian characteristics \\n schwannomas are known to mainly arise from the peripheral and caranial nerves , the extremities and the retroperitoneum . \\n they are seldom found in the abdomen , especially the extragastrointestinal tract , of which solitaly schwannoma of the great omentum is an extremely rare tumor . in 303 schwannomas reported by das gupta \\n , one case originated from the retroperitoneum , others from the central nervous system and peripheral nerve . in another review of the literature , stout and \\n of these , 37 were in the stomach , 3 in the small bowel , and none in the omentum and the abdominal cavity . previously published cases of schwannoma in the omentum were collected from a computerized medical literature search ( pubmed ) . only 6 cases of schwannoma from the great omentum have been observed   ( table 1 ) . \\n we can see that more cases of schwannoma from the lesser omentum have been recorded than from the great omentum . \\n it is mentioned that the lesser omentum contains a small amount of nerves in almost equal distribution , the great omentum has a paucity of nervous tissue and anatomically consists of fat and lymphatic tissue . \\n we found a case of malignant schwannoma arising from the omentum which demonstrated peritoneal metastasis , and another reported case of the small intestine emphasized poor prognosis since only 2 of 24 patients survived for more than 5 years . \\n benign schwannomas are also reported to increase in size and to eventually cause complications by compressing other organs or by causing bleeding in or outside the gastrointestinal tract . \\n pigmented schwannoma is another type of schwannoma , usually arising from the sympathetic nervous system . \\n additionally abdominal schwannomas cause diagnostic problems because clinical symptoms are uncharacteristic or misleading even if the tumor is large . \\n ct imaging typically showed a low attenuation mass , peripheral enhancement and cystic degeneration pattern . \\n mri disclosed schwannoma of low signal intensity on t1-weighted image and high signal intensity on t2-weighted image . in spite of these characteristic , it is difficult to exclude other abdominal tumors , leiomyomas , lymphomas and unspecified sarcomas etc . while previous cases confirm that the tumor may attain a considerable size , bigger than 5 cm or producing symptoms , our case of a schwannoma which was small and asymptomatic is hardly diagnosed . \\n however this tumor showing progression in size is thought to have potential to behave very aggressively despite benign histological features , which stresses the need of more information on this type of tumor and diagnosis . \\n consequently , histological analysis of the surgical specimen is necessary for a correct diagnosis , and common treatment for schwannoma is surgery . \\n therefore laparoscopic resection seemed to be the most adequate method to diagnose and rule out malignant tumor as a minimally invasive surgery . \\n the majority of tumors can be safely resected , the surgeon being careful of the dividing feeder vessels because schwannomas are well known as hypervascular tumors . to our knowledge \\n there are no case reports documenting other treatments , including chemotherapy for schwannomas in the abdominal cavity .\", \"coronary artery disease ( cad ) is a major public health problem worldwide and the single largest cause of mortality in the united states , responsible for one of every six deaths ( aha heart disease and stroke statistics , 2010 ) . \\n cad is caused by atherosclerosis , which is an inflammatory disease that involves multiple cell types , including circulating cells and cells in the vessel wall . despite advances in risk factor management on an epidemiological level , \\n various blood markers associated with increased risk for death and cardiovascular endpoints have been identified , but currently very few have been shown to have a diagnostic impact or important clinical implications that would affect patient management . \\n therefore , there is a great need for innovative biomarkers that can assess risk for cad , assess activity of the atherosclerotic process , and guide evaluation of therapy . \\n several recent studies have suggested that circulating micrornas could be useful as biomarkers for various human disease states , including cancer , acute myocardial infarction [ 47 ] , heart failure , and chronic vascular disease [ 8 , 9 ] . \\n micrornas ( mirnas ) are a recently recognized class of short ( 1925  nt ) , single - stranded , noncoding rnas that regulate an array of cellular functions through the degradation and translational repression of mrnas that contain complementary sequences \\n .   more than 1000 human mirnas have been identified , and , in tissues , mirnas regulate the expression of genes involved in critical cellular processes , including differentiation , growth , proliferation , and apoptosis . \\n importantly , mirnas are now regarded as rheostats that fine - tune expression of proteins involved in just about every process in human cells . \\n mirnas have been found in tissues , whole blood , serum , plasma , and other body fluids in a stable form that is protected from endogenous rnase activity [ 3 , 12 ] . \\n although the biological function of mirna is yet to be fully understood , tissue levels of specific mirnas have been shown to correlate with pathological development of different diseases . \\n mirnas function as managers in gene regulatory networks , and they are distinct from other biomarkers because they have a pathogenic role in the disease process and are not merely byproducts of the disease state . \\n thus , mirna expression signatures in tissues and blood have a potential role in the diagnosis , prognosis , and assessment of therapy . in this study \\n , we sought to compare mirna expression in whole blood of patients with angiographically significant cad to that of healthy aged - matched controls . \\n we performed an initial exploratory microarray analysis in 5 cases and controls and then further examined the most highly expressed mirnas in an additional 15 cases and controls . \\n study participants were recruited as part of the emory cardiology biobank , consisting of 3492 consecutive patients enrolled prior to undergoing elective or emergent cardiac catheterization across three emory healthcare sites , between 2003 and 2008 . \\n patients aged 2090 years were interviewed to collect demographic characteristics , medical history , and lifestyle habits . \\n risk factor prevalence was determined by physician diagnosis and/or treatment for hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and diabetes . \\n coronary angiograms were evaluated independently by two operators , who made visual estimation of luminal narrowing in multiple segments based on a modified form of the aha / acc classification of the coronary tree .   using these data , \\n significant cad was defined as at least one major epicardial vessel with > 50% stenosis , assessed by quantitative coronary angiography . additionally , we collected whole blood samples from patients with 2 risk factors for cad , but did not have angiographically significant cad . \\n the study was approved by the institutional review board at emory university , atlanta , ga , usa .   all subjects provided written informed consent at the time of enrollment . \\n the healthy subject cohort was a random sample of employees from emory university who were fully employed , productive people . \\n these subjects were aged 18 and older , not taking medications , and had not been hospitalized for at least one year prior to participation . \\n venous blood samples were drawn via antecubial venipuncture into paxgene blood rna tubes and stored at 20c within 24 hours before rna extraction . \\n mirna was isolated using the preanalytix paxgene mirna isolation kit ( qiagen ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol . \\n mirna microarray analysis was performed by asuragen , inc . , which uses the affymetrix manufactured genechip mirna arrays . \\n once labeled , the mirna targets were hybridized overnight onto the microarrays following which the arrays were washed and stained using streptavidin - phycoerythrin ( sape ) . \\n expression analysis was performed for all small rnas for homo sapiens ( e.g. , mirna , small nuclear rnas like snorna and scarna ) and separately for sanger mirna registry content ( mirbase 11.0 , http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/ ) for homo sapiens . \\n mirna reverse transcription was performed using the taqman microrna reverse transcription kit ( applied biosystems ) at 16c for 30 min , 42c for 30  min , and denaturation of the enzyme at 85c for 5  min . \\n the rt reaction was performed at 37c for 1 hour followed by 5  min at 95c . \\n taqman microrna assays ( applied biosystems ) were performed using the 7500 fast real - time pcr system at the 9600 emulation run mode . \\n ct values were converted into copy numbers ( copy no . = 2 ) and normalized to rnu44 . \\n unpaired student 's t - tests were used to compare data . a p value < .05 ( two sided ) was considered significant . for analysis of microarray expression data , \\n a two- sample t - test was carried out for every gene , followed by multiplicity correction to control the false discovery rate ( fdr ) at  .05 . \\n we initially performed expression profiling of all small rnas ( 1770 genes , figure 1 ) in the whole blood samples . \\n three mirnas passed the fdr cutoff of 0.05 : mir-584 ( 7.9-fold higher in healthy versus cad patients , p = .000103 , t - test ) , mir-542 - 5p ( 3.9-fold higher in healthy versus cad pts , p = .000168 , t - test ) , and mir-187 * ( 2.77-fold higher in healthy versus cad pts , p = 8.1  10 , t - test ) . \\n however , signal intensities for mir-542 - 5p and mir-187 * were very low and not detected in most samples . \\n separately , we performed an analysis of sanger registry mirnas ( 848 for homo sapiens ) in the whole blood samples , but none of the mirnas passed the fdr cutoff of 0.05 . \\n ten mirnas passed a fdr cutoff of 0.10 , but only one ( mir-129 - 5p , 1.57 fold higher in healthy patients , p = .000044 ) of these mirnas had consistently detectable signal across the 10 blood samples . \\n although we were able to detect some differences in whole blood mirna levels between healthy subjects and cad patients ( mir-584 , in particular ) , our microarray data suggest that , similar to other reports , levels of mirnas in the blood are low and microarrays may lack the sensitivity to adequately identify mirnas that might serve as vascular disease biomarkers . \\n interestingly , among the mirnas that tended to show consistent differences between healthy and cad blood , mirna expression was generally higher in the blood of healthy subjects , a finding previously observed by others . \\n next , we performed qrt - pcr on rna isolated from whole blood of another 10 patients with angiographically significant cad and 15 healthy subjects . \\n we evaluated the levels of mirnas that , based on our microarray data , were highly expressed in blood and tended to have different levels of expression between the two groups . \\n this analysis included mir-150 , mir-584 , mir-21 , mir-24 , mir-126 , mir-92a , mir-34a , mir-19a , mir-145 , mir-155 , mir-222 , mir-378 , mir-29a , mir-30e-5p , mir-342 , and mir-181d . among these we found that mir-19a , mir-584 , mir-155 , mir-222 , mir-145 , mir-29a , mir-378 , mir-342 , mir-181d , mir-150 , and mir-30e-5p were significantly downregulated in the blood of patients with cad compared to healthy subjects ( figure 2 ) . \\n furthermore , we also assessed expression of these 11 mirnas in a cohort of patients who had 2 risk factors for cad , but did not have angiographically significant cad . \\n we found that there was no difference in whole blood mirna expression of this latter group compared to that in patients with significant cad ( not shown ) , suggesting that these mirnas are markers for vascular inflammation rather than markers specific for significant cad . \\n there has been one report that mirna expression in blood may be influenced by medications .   indeed , one of the mirnas that we found to be downregulated in the blood of patients with cad is mir-155 , which is known to target the at1 receptor . \\n therefore , we assessed the impact of medications on expression of mir-155 , mir-145 , mir-181d , mir-222 , mir-19a , mir-342 , mir-29a , mir-30e-5p , and mir-378 . \\n we compared the mirna expression levels in the blood of patients with angiographically significant cad or 2 risk factors for cad but not on acei or arb to that in blood of similar patients who were taking at least one of medications . \\n interestingly , levels of mir-155 , mir-19a , mir-145 , mir-222 , mir-342 , mir-30e-5p , and mir-378 ( figure 3 ) were significantly decreased in patients taking acei or arb compared to those who were not , suggesting that these medications may directly modulate expression of these mirnas , or they may influence inflammatory factors that otherwise regulate their expression . \\n importantly , we did not find that statin use had a significant effect on the levels of mirnas identified in this study ( not shown ) . \\n several recent studies have indicated that there is a potential role for circulating mirna levels as valuable biomarkers for different disease processes , including cancer , cardiomyopathy , and acute myocardial infarction .   in this study , we wanted to address the hypothesis that mirna expression levels in blood could predict the presence of significant coronary artery disease in human subjects . \\n we identified 11 mirnas whose expression was significantly downregulated in patients with angiographic evidence of significant atherosclerosis compared to healthy subjects that were matched for age and gender . \\n in addition , our data suggest that inhibition of the renin angiotensin system by acei or arb use further influences mirna expression in blood . \\n this study confirms previous reports showing differences in circulating mirna levels of patients with cad compared to those of healthy subjects [ 8 , 16 ] . \\n our study differs from the other studies in the content of the group of mirnas that were downregulated in patients with cad . \\n we performed this analysis using the paxgene blood rna system because it provides a way to stabilize rna immediately after sample collection and facilitates storage of the samples for a relatively long period of time without compromising rna integrity [ 17 , 18 ] . \\n importantly , mrna profiling of whole blood or peripheral mononuclear cells has been previously applied to cardiovascular disease [ 19 , 20 ] , and a relationship has been identified between mrna levels in whole blood and extent of coronary artery disease . \\n our study extends this work by providing insight into the whole blood expression of mirnas that are potentially involved in regulating these cad genes . in our qrt - pcr analysis of whole blood samples from cad patients \\n , we found similar changes in expression of mir-155 and mir-145 as what has been reported previously . \\n however , we failed to detect changes in other mirnas that were described in this previous report , namely mir-126 and mir-92a . \\n first , we studied whole blood samples , whereas plasma was studied previously .   thus our mirna profile \\n likely reflects intracellular and extracellular mirnas levels in contrast to exclusively extracellular mirnas that would be detected in plasma . \\n another difference in our study is that we normalized mirna expression to expression of rnu44 , a small nucleolar rna that , based on our microarray analysis , we found to be highly and consistently expressed across blood samples from cad patients and controls . \\n this study confirmed the observation made by others regarding the difficulty of using microarray analysis to profile mirna expression in blood samples .   undoubtedly , this is in part due to the limitation of a relatively small sample size for our microarray analysis , as well as reduced sensitivity of the microarray method compared to qrt - pcr . \\n in addition , principal component analysis of our data suggested that two of the mirna profiles for healthy subjects were actually similar to that of the cad patients , suggesting that these individuals may in fact have subclinical vascular inflammation . \\n , we believe that careful selection of patients and well - matched control subjects from a larger group of well - characterized individuals reduced some of the variability in our qrt - pcr analysis \\n . we can only speculate as to why expression of circulated mirnas is generally decreased in patients with cad . \\n it has been hypothesized that levels of circulating mirnas are decreased in vascular disease because they have been taken up into atherosclerotic lesions . \\n the levels of circulating mirnas may be affected by multiple factors , including transcription , processing and stability of the mirnas within circulating cells , as well as the ability of these cells to release mirnas into the plasma . \\n circulating mirnas may be delivered to cells in the heart or blood vessels through microvesicles , exosomes , or apoptotic bodies .   because our study assessed mirna expression in whole blood , \\n our findings are likely more reflective of changes in mirna transcription or processing rather than release from the circulating cells . \\n it remains to be determined whether downregulation of mirnas in cad patients is directly involved in inflammation or a compensatory response to this process . \\n based on our observed changes in mirna expression in response to acei / arb therapy , we believe that circulating mirna levels reflect a compensatory response to inflammation .   further experimental studies are necessary to explore the mechanisms by which cad and therapies affect tissue versus circulating mirna levels . in summary , \\n the present study provides insight into whole blood levels of mirnas in patients with cad compared to healthy subjects and demonstrates their potential utility as biomarkers for vascular disease . \\n validation of the changes in mirna expression observed here in larger studies will be a necessary step to confirm their candidacy as biomarkers and therapeutic targets . \\n we believe that further elucidation of the role that these mirnas play in the pathogenesis and progression of chronic cad will contribute to our understanding of the disease process and lead to new therapeutic and preventative strategies .\", \"among eusocial insects , paper wasps ( hymenoptera : vespidae : polistinae ) are notable for the diversity of their nest architecture ( jeanne , 1975 ; wenzel , 1991 ) . \\n many swarm - founding polistine wasps , including most species of the neotropical tribe epiponini , construct envelopes around their brood combs . \\n comparative and experimental studies suggest that , among other functions , nest envelopes reduce rates of predation and parasitism on wasp brood ( london and jeanne , 1998 ; smith et al . , 2001 ) . \\n however , little is known about the adaptive significance of variation in the materials that wasps use to construct nest envelopes ( hansell 1984 ; wenzel , 1991 ; cole et al . , 2001 ) . \\n polybia emaciata is unusual among the polistine wasps because it uses mud , rather than wood pulp or plant fibers , as the main raw material for nest construction ( schremmer , 1984 ) . \\n the genus polybia includes 56 described species ; of these , only the other three species in the subgenus pedothoeca , and one species in the subgenus furnariana , share the derived trait of mud nest construction ( richards , 1978 ; jeanne , 1991 ; cooper , 1993 ) . \\n no other swarm - founding polistine wasps are known to build primarily mud nests , although small amounts of inorganic material are sometimes incorporated into the nest paper of other species ( wenzel , 1991 ) . \\n the nest of p. emaciata is otherwise typical of the genus ( jeanne , 1975 ; wenzel , 1991 ) , being phragmocyttarus ( comprising horizontal layers of comb that are conjoined and enclosed by a continuous envelope ) with a single small entrance hole near the bottom of the nest . \\n numbers of adults in mature colonies are relatively small for the genus , ranging from fewer than 100 up to about 500 adults ( richards , 1978 ; chadab , 1979 ; strassmann et al . , 1992 ) . \\n polybia emaciata nests are hard and much more durable than most paper nests of similar size and shape ( rau , 1933 ; richards , 1978 ) . \\n for example , skutch ( 1971 ) noted that nests of this species in costa rica were unlike paper nests in that they persisted for several years . \\n the high durability of p. emaciata construction material suggests that the nest itself may provide greater brood protection than paper nests . \\n if so , we hypothesized that the wasps ' defensive responses to vertebrate attacks have changed to take advantage of nest durability . \\n we predicted that the nests ' protective properties reduced the need for behavioral defenses by p. emaciata workers , relative to paper - nesting polybia species with similar colony and nest sizes . \\n we tested this prediction by disturbing p. emaciata colonies , and comparing the workers ' responses to those of simultaneously observed paper - nesting p. occidentalis colonies in the same location . \\n chadab ( 1979 ) surveyed the defensive responses of swarm - founding paper wasps to vertebrate - like disturbances , including tapping on the nest and/or on the supporting vegetation . the most frequently observed response was for dozens to hundreds of workers to rush out onto the nest envelope , sometimes adopting aposematic postures ( see also o'donnell et al . , \\n response was seen in the genera angiopolybia , charterginus , leipomeles , parachartergus , polybia , pseudopolybia , and synoeca , and accords with our observations of what appears to be typical epiponine defensive behavior . \\n weaker exit - nest responses ( either requiring several taps , or involving fewer wasps ) were seen in species of leipomeles , metapolybia , and protopolybia . \\n interspecific variation in mature colony size was not a good predictor of the type of defensive response , as species with colony sizes smaller and larger than p. emaciata performed nest exiting defensive behavior . \\n an attack response often coincides with , or quickly follows , the nest exit response and involves workers flying from the nest , striking the intruder , and attempting to sting ( hermann and blum , 1981 ) . \\n when paper - using polybia nests are tapped , some of the workers on the nest surface may immediately perform attacks , while large numbers of workers rush out of the nest entrance and stand in alert posture on the envelope ( jeanne , 1981 ; jeanne et al . , 1992 ) . \\n further tapping elicits additional attacks . breathing on the nest surface or into the nest results in immediate attack by several to dozens of workers . \\n we discuss the possible adaptive significance of deviations from the typical nest exit that have been documented in several paper wasp species , including p. emaciata . \\n this study was conducted in and near the town of gamboa , panama province , republic of panama ( 0907n 7942w ; 50 m elevation ) . \\n observations and manipulations were conducted during the wet season from 1 august to 15 october 1990 and from 3 to 5 july 1998 . \\n surveys of eusocial wasp colonies during these periods indicated that p. emaciata was among the most abundant swarm - founding wasps in terms of nest density ( s.o'd . , unpublished data ) . \\n most of the data presented were collected from four colonies of p. emaciata and five colonies of p. occidentalis that had been moved approximately 0.5 km to 1 km from their natural nesting sites to artificial supports to facilitate observation . \\n all subject colonies were moved into a small area ( < 0.25 ha ) , with similar amounts of tree cover ( one p. occidentalis colony was additionally sheltered by building eaves ) . \\n all colonies were in place at least 2 weeks before observations on defense behavior were initiated , and all continued to forage and to raise brood ( visible through the nest entrance in the lower combs ) throughout the observation period . \\n the p. emaciata observation colonies had nests ranging in size from 9 cm long to 22 cm long . \\n the numbers of adult wasps and colony age probably varied positively with nest size , though we did not measure these variables . \\n we also collected data opportunistically from p. emaciata colonies in situ in 1990 and again in 1998 . \\n these nests were located in the gamboa area on thin tree branches from 1.5 m to 5 m above the ground . \\n we disturbed p. emaciata and p. occidentalis colonies in an effort to evoke defensive behavior , using stimuli that elicited nest exit and attack responses in costa rican p. occidentalis ( s.o'd . and \\n we disturbed the polybia nests by first tapping on the side of the outer envelope near the middle of the nest for 30 sec while wearing a full bee suit , and we noted the responses of on - nest and in - nest workers . \\n if there was no attack response to tapping , we blew into the nest entrance for 30 sec . \\n each polybia observation colony was disturbed 10 times over the course of the study period in 1990 . \\n the in situ nests of p. emaciata were tested once each in a similar fashion . \\n we used a non - parametric wilcoxon test for species differences in the probability of immediate attack responses using the four p. emaciata and five p. occidentalis observation colonies . \\n trials were pooled within colonies and each colony was used as a single data point in the analysis . \\n all observation and in situ polybia colonies contained brood ( larvae and/or pupae were visible in the lower combs ) when they were tested . based on forager traffic and on the numbers of wasps exiting the nests during attacks \\n polybia emaciata only rarely ( 5 occasions out of 40 trials on the observation nests and 2 occasions out of > 15 trials on in situ nests ) exhibited a typical polybia attack response within 30 sec when the nest was tapped . \\n polybia emaciata workers never rushed out of the nest and onto the nest envelope . in all trials where the wasps did not attack in response to the initial mechanical disturbance ( within the first 30 sec ) , \\n some of the workers on the nest surface flew off the nest and departed ; the remainder rapidly entered the nest . \\n after the initial disturbance , the nest surface and the lowest layer of comb ( partially visible through the nest entrance , fig . \\n breathing into the nest entrance did not elicit rapid ( within 10 sec ) attack responses . \\n after continued disturbance within a trial ( breath and tapping ) , p. emaciata workers often attacked violently . in approximately 75% of trials , \\n several dozen individuals rapidly exited the nest , took flight , and struck and attempted to sting the observer 's bee veil . \\n the p. emaciata nests were not abandoned following these attacks , and workers later returned to the nests . \\n in contrast , all 50 nest - tapping trials with p. occidentalis resulted in immediate ( within 1 sec ) exit - nest and attack responses . \\n the species difference in the per - colony probability of nest exit and attack within 30 sec of disturbance was significant ( fig . \\n 2 ; wilcoxon 2-tailed test , z=2.60 , p<0.01 ) . breathing in or on p. occidentalis nests always elicited immediate attack responses , therefore , habituation to tapping and breathing stimuli was not evident over the course of the study in p. occidentalis . \\n the four p. emaciata observation nests suffered no damage while exposed to nearly daily heavy rains for 3 weeks ; four of the p. occidentalis observation nests in the same location were visibly damaged by rain during the same period . even during heavy downpours \\n , the mud nests repelled water much longer than nearby p. occidentalis nests . during one rain shower \\n , the mud nests did not appear waterlogged until 15 min of rainfall had elapsed , while p. occidentalis nests stopped shedding water and became waterlogged after < 5 min . \\n the nest fell 2 m to the ground , with only minor damage to its envelope , and the nest was still occupied by adult wasps when it was collected within 12 h of falling . \\n rather than exiting and attacking within a few sec of vibrational disturbance , p. emaciata workers usually either departed or fled into the nest interior . unlike many other paper wasps ( s.o'd . and r.l.j . , personal observation ) , p. emaciata failed to respond aggressively to human breath , even when we blew directly into the nest entrance . \\n polybia emaciata behavioral responses to nest disturbance were unusual among their congeners , and among paper - nesting epiponini with similar colony sizes ( s.o'd and r.l.j . personal observation ; chadab , 1979 ) . however , a few species of paper wasps in other genera exhibit similar responses to human disturbance , which chadab ( 1979 ) labeled \\n richards ( 1978 ) collected a p. emaciata colony in brazil , and the wasps did not exit the nest until 1.5 h after it was collected . \\n residents of costa rica from several rural communities reported collecting and moving active p. emaciata colonies without being stung , by placing a finger over the nest entrance and plucking the nest from its attachment point . \\n chadab ( 1979 ) noted that one colony of p. emaciata in ecuador had  durable  nest paper and exhibited defensive retreat responses like those that we recorded ; two other p. emaciata colonies had  fragile  nests and performed exit - nest and attack behavior when jarred . \\n we did not observe qualitative variation in p. emaciata nest durability in panama ( > 50 colonies observed ; not all were tested for defensive responses ) . \\n predation on swarm - founding wasp nests by bats ( jeanne , 1970a ) , birds ( skutch , 1971 ; windsor , 1976 ) , and primates ( vecht , 1967 ) has been documented . \\n we hypothesize that the unusual defensive response of p. emaciata is a behavioral adaptation to its use of mud in nest construction , which may make the nest more resistant than paper to entry by vertebrate predators . \\n it appears that the wasps initially rely on the nest itself , rather than on exit and attack behavior , to thwart vertebrate predators . \\n we suggest that this represents a special type of architectural defense ( hermann and blum , 1981 ) , where the defensive behavior of a species has been modified to exploit the properties of its nest material \\n skutch ( 1959 ) observed a red throated caracara ( daptrius americanus ) removing combs from a p. emaciata nest and feeding on the brood in costa rica . \\n our subject nests often responded with attack behavior after extended disturbances , suggesting that attack can be effective for this species . \\n when attack did come it was sudden and massive , suggesting that it was coordinated by an alarm pheromone , as has been demonstrated for p. occidentalis ( jeanne , 1981 ) . \\n although army ants are among swarm - founding wasps ' most frequent predators in wet tropical habitats , preliminary tests on the reaction to eciton army ants did not suggest that p. emaciata 's mud nest is effective in resisting these predators ( chadab , 1979 ; s.o'd . personal observation ) . \\n the use of mud as a nesting material may have evolved in response to predation pressure , particularly by vertebrate enemies . \\n similar advantages against hornet ( vespa ) predation may have favored the evolution of mud construction in hover wasps of the genus liostenogaster ( hansell 1984 ; turillazzi 1991 ) . however , mud construction appears to provide other benefits . \\n our observations suggest that p. emaciata mud nests were more water repellent , and more resistant to mechanical damage , than similarly sized paper nests . \\n even if increases in general durability were the original selective advantage driving the evolution of mud construction , the workers ' defensive behavior has apparently been secondarily modified . \\n there is variability in average colony size and in the details of nest architecture among species within the mud - nesting polybia subgenus pedothoeca , and in the independently evolved mud - nester p. furnaria ( richards , 1978 ; carpenter et al . , 2000 ) . \\n of special value to our understanding of the evolutionary significance of the mud - nesting habit will be field studies on the defensive behaviors of the other mud - nesting polybia species . \\n in particular , such studies could establish whether retreat behavior in response to vertebrate disturbance always accompanies the use of mud in nest building . \\n useful comparisons of defensive behavior could also be made to epiponine paper - nesters with relatively strong nest paper , such as epipona and chartergus . \\n retreat behavior in response to vertebrate disturbance is not restricted to mud - nesting species of epiponini . \\n similar responses to human approach or nest vibration have been observed in paper- and secretion - nesting species ( protopolybia emortualis , protopolybia exigua , and protopolybia ( formerly pseudochartergus ) fuscatus ) and in cavity - nesting agelaia cajennensis ( jeanne , 1970b ; chadab , 1979 ; carpenter et al . , 2001 ) . \\n paper - nesting polybia jurenei colonies retreated when their nest tree was rubbed , but exited and attacked when the substrate was jarred ( s. o'd . \\n these patterns suggest that retreat behavior has evolved convergently in several lineages of epiponini , perhaps in response to particular types of predators . \\n photograph of a mud nest of polybia emaciata collected july 1998 in gamboa , panama . \\n box plots showing the range of probabilities of response to nest disturbance with attack within 30 sec by polybia emaciata and p. occidentalis colonies .\", \"the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents has widely increased worldwide [ 1 , 2 ] , making it one of the most common chronic disorders in this age group and in adulthood . \\n the use of body mass index ( bmi ) for age to define being overweight and obese in children and adolescents is well established for both clinical and public health applications , because of their feasibility under clinical settings and in epidemiological studies [ 3 , 4 ] . in children and adolescents , \\n the natural increases in bmi that occur with age necessitate the use of age - sex - specific thresholds . \\n the most widely used growth charts are the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc-2000 ) , the international task force ( iotf ) , and the 2007 growth references for 5 to 19 year olds produced by the world health organization ( who-2007 ) .   the cdc-2000 growth charts were developed to evaluate the nutritional status of us children and were originated from five cross - sectional representative surveys carried out in the us between 1963 and 1994 . \\n these growth charts are routinely applied to identify children and adolescents with a bmi greater than the 85th or 95th percentiles following the advice of the us expert committee on childhood obesity . \\n however , the appropriateness of an american dataset for defining overweight in young people from other countries is questionable . \\n the iotf reference also uses age - sex - specific bmi percentiles , and overweight and obesity definition corresponds to an adult bmi of 25 and 30  kg / m , respectively , and reflects values in children tracking to overweight and obesity in adults . \\n this reference is based on six large international cross - sectional representative datasets , identifying the bmi values that extrapolate to childhood . \\n the who-2007 growth references were created to replace the national center for health statistics ( nchs ) references [ 10 , 11 ] . \\n this reference was constructed using data from the 1977 nchs / who growth reference ( 1 to 24 years old ) merged with data from the 2006 who child growth standards for preschool children ( under 5 years of age ) using state - of - the - art statistical methods . \\n although valuable information has been appearing in the literature or online , such as works from the health behaviour of school - aged children study which is mainly related to social determinants of health and well - being among young people , no systematic review has been conducted to understand the worldwide magnitude of the overweight and obesity problem among the adolescent population . \\n thus , the objective of this study was to systematically review the literature regarding the prevalence of overweight and obesity in adolescents ( 1019 years old ) of both sexes published in the past 12 academic years ( 19992011 ) . \\n a systematic literature search was performed which ended on june 7 , 2012 ( see figure 1 ) . \\n the literature search was conducted in medline and scopus using the following mesh terms :  overweight  ;  obesity  ;  prevalence  ;  adolescent  . in total , 2537 articles were selected . \\n we also reviewed the data on the prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity on the international obesity task force website at http://www.iaso.org / iotf/. to find the articles included in this review , the following inclusion criteria were used : ( 1 ) cross - sectional studies conducted in the last 12 years ( 19992011)when the original study did not report the survey year , it was not included ; ( 2 ) national and regional representative samples , but articles published on the prevalence of overweight in towns , urban , or rural areas in a country were excluded ; ( 3 ) weight and height objectively measured ; ( 4 ) results presented by sex ; ( 5 ) and for both overweight and obesity prevalence ; ( 6 ) the definition of overweight and obesity using the ( i ) cdc-2000 , ( ii ) iotf , and ( iii ) who-2007   growth references ; and ( 7 ) studies written in english , spanish , italian , or portuguese . \\n moreover , if there were more than one national or regional study in the same country , the most recent one was included in the prevalence tables ( except for usa   and canada , countries in which the most recent data was not included in the tables due to differences in the representativeness of the samples   and the impossibility to calculate a single prevalence of overweight and obesity for adolescents ' boys and girls ; however , no differences in prevalence were observed between studies as it has been indicated in the discussion ) . \\n the final number of articles included in this review was 39 articles related to overweight and obesity and also a study on the latest statistics on the prevalence of overweight and obesity in south africa . \\n potentially relevant papers were selected by ( 1 ) screening the titles ; ( 2 ) screening the abstracts , and ( 3 ) if abstracts were not available or did not provide sufficient data , the entire article was retrieved and screened to determine whether it met the inclusion criteria . \\n full - text articles were assessed by 2 authors ( m. m. bibiloni and j. a. tur ) . \\n any matter of doubt was discussed by at least two of the reviewers ( m. m. bibiloni , a. pons , and j. a. tur ) . \\n a total of thirty - nine articles and a national health report were eligible according to the inclusion criteria established for this review . \\n table 1 presents a description of the forty studies selected for this review including the continent and the country where it was performed ( and region for not national studies ) , year of publishing , total number of participants in the study , number of adolescents , age range , proportion of girls , and number and definition for overweight and obesity classification used . \\n nationally representative data were obtained in twenty - five countries ( including northern ireland ) [ 1539 ] , and ten countries were represented only by regional data [ 40 , 42 , 44 , 45 , 47 , 5054 ] . \\n table 2 shows overweight and obesity prevalence from the twenty - five national studies ( one of them including data from northern ireland ) that were included in this review according to the continent and the country where it was performed , year of survey , study population , age range , criteria used for classifying overweight and obesity used , and along with total data by sex . \\n there were thirty - two different prevalence levels described in the included articles , because five countries presented data using at least two different criteria for overweight and obesity classification [ 18 , 23 , 27 , 36 , 39 ] . \\n the iotf cut - off was used to classify overweight and obesity in twenty - three of the twenty - five national studies considered in the present review . \\n in general , the prevalence of overweight plus obesity was higher in america [ 1820 ] , oceania [ 38 , 39 ] and europe [ 3037 ] and lower in africa [ 1517 ] and certain parts of asia [ 2129 ] ( in china   and iran   the total prevalence was less than 10% by the iotf cut - offs ) . \\n overall , about 30% of american adolescents and 22%25% of european adolescents ( excepting the czech republic and italian adolescents ' which showed a prevalence of 13.7% and 17.9% , resp . ) were overweight or obese . among oceanian adolescents the prevalence ranged from 23.2% in australia in 2004 to 34.2% in new zealand in 2007 . \\n in africa , the overall prevalence of overweight and obesity was lower than 20% . among asian adolescents there was a broad range of overweight plus obesity . using \\n iotf cut - off , the prevalence of being overweight or obese for asian boys and girls ranged from 5.2% in china in 2002 to 36.4% in bahrain in 2000 . \\n specific prevalence from all the geographic regions was included in this review from three countries : south africa ( nine provinces ) , usa ( fifty two states ) , and italy ( five regions ) . in europe , data from islands of greece ( crete )   and italy ( sicily and sardinia ) [ 48 , 49 ] and spain ( balearic islands ' archipelago ; and the grand canary island ) were also included . on the other hand , regional but not national data was found for eleven countries ( italy , brazil , india , jordan , denmark , france , hungary , poland , spain [ 51 , 52 ] , switzerland , and turkey ) . \\n the iotf cut - off was used to classify overweight and obesity in fourteen of the eighteen selected studies that included regional data . in one study \\n , data was presented using only the who-2007 growth charts and in two studies using only the cdc-2000 growth reference [ 20 , 43 ] . in south africa and usa , substantial geographic variations in adolescent \\n overweight and obesity prevalence varied in south africa from 13.5% in limpopo to 25.5% in kwazulu - natal . in 2007 , overweight and obesity varied in usa from 23.1% in utah and minnesota to 44.5% in mississippi . in 2002 , \\n the prevalence of overweight and obesity in southern italy and italian islands was higher among boys . \\n in southern italy , the overweight prevalence among girls also was higher than in the other geographic regions . \\n comparison between the islands from greece ( crete ) , italy ( sicily and sardinia ) , and spain ( balearic islands and grand canary island ) which were included in this review showed that crete had the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity  despite data were presented using different definition . in spain \\n , using the iotf cut - off ( data not shown for balearic islands but given by authors ) , the prevalence of overweight plus obesity was higher in the grand canary island ( 29.1% ) than in the balearic islands ( 24.7% ) . \\n according to national data , the prevalence of overweight among boys was 10% higher than girls in nine countries ( canada , qatar , taiwan , cyprus , czech republic , germany , greece , italy , australia , denmark , and hungary ) and among girls 10% higher than boys in seven of the twenty - five countries ( south africa , seychelles , tunisia , mexico , bahrain , saudi arabia , and sweden ) . \\n the obesity prevalence was 10% higher among boys in seventeen countries ( canada , usa , china , iran , israel , qatar , saudi arabia , taiwan , cyprus , czech republic , germany , greece , italy , portugal , sweden , australia , new zealand , denmark , and hungary ) and 10% higher among girls in four of the twenty - five countries ( south africa , seychelles , tunisia , and bahrain ) . \\n the aim of this study was to review systematically the literature on overweight and obesity prevalence among adolescents worldwide . \\n thirty - nine articles and one national health report that met the inclusion criteria were considered . \\n the overweight and obesity prevalence in the included studies ranged widely . in sixteen of the twenty - three countries with national representative data using the iotf cut - off , overweight and obesity prevalence \\n higher than 20% were found , five countries showed prevalence above 30% , and just in two countries prevalence was lower than 10% . \\n regarding national data , when prevalence was analysed according to sex , it was observed that boys showed a higher prevalence of overweight in almost half of the countries and a higher prevalence of obesity in almost all countries . \\n these results are consistent with previous studies that pointed out a high prevalence of abdominal obesity among boys \\n . differences of prevalence of overweight and obesity between genders have been related to geopolitical and cultural conditions . \\n eight articles compared data between 1980s and/or 1990s with 2000s [ 16 , 19 , 20 , 22 , 28 , 32 , 37 , 50 ] and pointed out an increased prevalence of overweight and obesity in both sexes over this period . however , among australian adolescents   the overweight and obesity prevalence increased significantly among boys but not among girls over the period 19972004 . in the australian national children 's nutrition and physical activity survey 2007 ( ncnpas07 ) , 25% of boys and 30% of girls aged 9- to 13-year - olds and 25% of boys and \\n 23% of girls aged 14- to 16-year - olds were overweight or obese using the iotf criteria . \\n a comparison of the 1985 , 1995 , and 2007 australian national surveys of 7- to 15-year - olds indicated that australian children are changing body shape to a more central fat distribution . in usa , \\n overweight and obesity prevalence increased by 3% and 18% among usa girls over this period . \\n however , a cross - sectional analyses of a representative sample ( n = 4111 ) of the usa child and adolescent population ( birth through 19 years of age ) with data from the national health and nutrition examination survey 2009 - 10 ( nhanes ) indicated a prevalence of overweight and obesity among adolescents aged 12 through 19 years of 15.2% and 18.4% , respectively . analyses of trends in obesity prevalence for the last two nhanes surveys ( 2007 - 08 and 2009 - 10 ) indicated that the prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents has not changed in 2009 - 10 compared with 2007 - 08 . on the other hand , since 2004 the overweight and obesity trends were stabilized or decreased among german adolescents . in usa , substantial geographic disparities in adolescent overweight and obesity were found , with an apparent shift toward higher prevalence in 2007 for several states . \\n reported that children in northern europe countries generally tended to have lower overweight and obesity prevalence ( 1020% ) than in southern europe ( 2035% ) . \\n also within the same country , the prevalence and trends of overweight and obesity may not be homogeneous according to different geographic regions . in italy , \\n a north - south gradient in overweight and obesity prevalence among boys but also in overweight prevalence among girls was also reported . \\n a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity has been reported in southern spain in both children   and adults . \\n it is important to note that the choice of a reference and a cut - off point will determine the absolute prevalence of overweight and obesity and its trends , and hence different information will be obtained from the papers . \\n argued that the reference they published , supported by the iotf , is less arbitrary and more international than others and recommended its use in international comparisons . \\n lately , monasta et al .   suggested that the iotf reference and cut - offs could be preferable to identify overweight and obesity both at individual and population levels because they are at least based on a crude association with ill and health later in life , namely , the definition of overweight and obesity at age 18 years . \\n however , the iotf cut - offs have been not recommended for clinical use when assessing an individual child 's growth [ 9 , 6264 ] . \\n furthermore , recent findings suggested that a universal bmi classification system for childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity may not correspond to a comparable level of body fatness in all populations . \\n the prevalence estimates may not accurately characterize the population groups most at risk of health disadvantages because the correlation of bmi with adiposity is highly variable and dependent on ethnic group [ 9 , 60 , 65 , 66 ] . \\n the comparisons of overweight and obesity prevalence need interpretation with caution due to the difference in survey sampling methods , sample sizes , age range of subjects , quality of data in terms of height and weight measurement , and whether national programmes or strategies to tackle overweight and obesity are in place . even within the same country \\n , the prevalence and trends of overweight and obesity may not be homogenous in view of different ethnicities , geographic regions , and socioeconomic status . only articles in english , spanish , italian , and portuguese were included in this review . \\n the results of this review allow the following conclusions : ( 1 ) overweight and obesity prevalence is high ; ( 2 ) obesity is higher among boys , although it is not clear which sex has a higher proportion of adolescents with overweight ; ( 3 ) despite that there is no consensus about criteria to be used to classify adolescents as overweighed or obese , the most frequently used was the iotf reference . \\n however , the international reference charts for monitoring the secular trends in childhood obesity need to be continually refined and evaluated . the results of this study would contribute to guiding health planners and administrators to develop proper tools for adolescent obesity management .\", 'sacubitril / valsartan is a combination of a neprilysin inhibitor and an angiotensin ii receptor blocker , indicated to decrease the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure.a patient previously stable on atorvastatin developed severe rhabdomyolysis and an elevation of transaminases within 26  days of initiation of sacubitril / valsartan . \\n rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome characterized by skeletal muscle cell damage , leading to elevated creatine kinase ( ck ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) , and aspartate aminotranferase ( ast ) , which can result in severe sequelae , including renal failure , cardiac arrhythmia , hyperthermia and death . \\n associated elevations in transaminases may be seen , even in the absence of significant liver injury . \\n clinically , rhabdomyolysis classically presents with muscle pain , weakness and dark , red or tea - colored urine ; however , less than 10% of patients will demonstrate all three components of this triad . \\n rhabdomyolysis may be triggered by hereditary and/or acquired mechanisms , with approximately 75% of initial episodes being a result of acquired causes . in particular , a large number of prescription drugs and drugs of abuse can cause rhabdomyolysis , with statins being one of the top three prescription drugs most commonly responsible for rhabdomyolysis for this syndrome . \\n myopathy and myositis have been reported in conjunction with all of the currently available statins and are considered to be a class effect of these medications . \\n in addition , it has been recognized that statin - associated muscle complaints are dose - related and drug  drug interactions that cause an elevation of statin levels have been identified . \\n subgroups of patients at greater risk of statin - associated muscle pathology have been identified and include age > 70  years , impaired renal function , and impaired hepatic function . \\n entresto is a combination of sacubitril , a neprilysin inhibitor , and valsartan , an angiotensin ii receptor blocker ( arb ) , indicated to decrease the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure ( new york heart association [ nyha ] class ii \\n sacubitril / valsartan is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure drug regimens instead of an angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor ( acei ) or another arb . \\n the commonly occurring ( 5% ) adverse reactions reported are hypotension , hyperkalemia , cough , dizziness , and renal failure [ 6 , 7 ] . \\n sacubitril / valsartan has not been associated with rhabdomyolysis and is commonly used in patients who are also receiving statin therapy . \\n a 63-year - old guyanese woman with hypertension , hyperlipidemia , congestive heart failure ( chf ) , atrial fibrillation , and peripheral vascular disease presented to her primary care provider s office with a complaint of an episode of weakness at home associated with general malaise . \\n she was receiving atorvastatin 40  mg daily , carvedilol 25  mg twice daily , digoxin 0.125  mg daily , furosemide 40  mg daily , spironolactone 25  mg daily , rivaroxaban 15  mg daily , and sacubitril / valsartan 24/26  mg twice daily . \\n she was initiated on sacubitril / valsartan 22  days before her clinical presentation and had been on all of her other concurrent medications for more than 1  year . on the review of systems , \\n the patient reported generalized weakness , pain in her knees , and an ill - defined stinging pain in the skin of her arms and legs . \\n her physical examination was non - focal , with no muscle weakness or tenderness of either the skin or muscles noted . \\n laboratory tests performed on presentation were significant for elevated ast / alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) of 351  u / l/131 \\n be having a reaction to her statin therapy prescribed for hyperlipidemia and therefore the atorvastatin was withheld . \\n she was scheduled to return in 4  days for repeat laboratory testing and re - evaluation . \\n when the patient returned in 4  days , she complained of dark urine , generalized weakness , and increased muscle and skin pain throughout her body . \\n she was then found to have rhabdomyolysis , with ck at 58,349  u / l ( > 50 the upper limit of normal ) . \\n sacubitril / valsartan was stopped at this time as it was the only new medication in her regimen . \\n the ck level decreased steadily and her symptoms resolved over the course of a 5-day hospitalization ( fig .  1 ) . \\n her renal function was preserved throughout and her bilirubin and transaminases briefly increased and also subsequently steadily decreased ( figs .  2 , 3 ) . \\n barr virus , hepatitis a , herpes simplex virus , hiv , and cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) . \\n barr virus , and herpes simplex virus , and had negative hepatitis a and b , hiv , hsv . and cmv tests.fig . \\n ast aspartate aminotransferase , alt alanine

patient no longer had any muscle or skin pain and her ck and liver function test ( lft ) levels were completely normalized . \\n the patient has not had any reoccurrence of rhabdomyolysis and elevated transaminases for 46  days , and her bilirubin and transaminase levels also returned to normal ( figs .  2 , 3 ) . \\n one week later , the patient was started on an alternate statin at a low dose ( rosuvastatin 5  mg ) and the ck levels and lfts have remained stable . \\n this patient had been on a variety of statins for more than 7  years , including atorvastatin , simvastatin , and rosuvastatin . \\n her baseline ck and lfts were normal prior to the initiation of sacubitril / valsartan . \\n she had previously experienced two transient elevations in ck , to a maximum of 1608 \\n u / l , while hospitalized for an implantable defibrillator infection and explanation complicated by an acute chf exacerbation and a recurrent chf exacerbation in the 3  years prior to the current admission . \\n her ck levels returned to normal after her acute illnesses , without change in her lfts . in this case , the immediate cause of her rhabdomyolysis was unknown , but the new medication in her profile seemed to be the likely trigger . due to the severity of her rhabdomyolysis \\n the naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale score was 5 , making it probable that the adverse drug reaction was precipitated by sacubitril / valsartan . \\n the drug interaction probability scale score was 3 , consistent with a possible interaction as a cause for the reaction , with sacubitril / valsartan as the precipitant drug and atorvastatin as the object drug . \\n of note , one of the concurrent medications , carvedilol , is a p - glycoprotein inhibitor that may increase the serum concentration of atorvastatin , a p - glycoprotein substrate ; however , the patient was stable on this combination for 7  years before sacubitril / valsartan was initiated . \\n none of the other medications taken by this patient are known to cause rhabdomyolysis or an elevation in transaminases . \\n a literature search regarding a drug interaction between sacubitril and statins yielded no reports of rhabdomyolysis with statins . \\n as per a recent study , coadministration of sacubitril / valsartan with atorvastatin led to a twofold increase in the maximum concentration ( c \\n max ) of atorvastatin and its metabolites . \\n in addition , the us and canadian package inserts of sacubitril / valsartan cite in vitro data showing sacubitril inhibiting organic anion transporting polypeptides ( oatp ) 1b1 and 1b3 , resulting in increased c \\n max and area under the curve ( auc ) of atorvastatin with coadministration of sacubitril / valsartan [ 6 , 7 ] . the canadian version of the product insert further states that sacubitril / valsartan may increase the systemic exposure of oatp1b1 and oatp1b3 substrates , such as statins . \\n sacubitril / valsartan increases the c \\n max of atorvastatin and its metabolites by up to twofold , and auc by up to 1.3-fold . \\n the canadian insert recommends that sacubitril / valsartan must be coadministered cautiously with statins , especially simvastatin , a sensitive oatp1b1/1b3 substrate , and a decrease in dose of simvastatin and atorvastatin may be considered when coadministered with sacubitril / valsartan . \\n the interaction between atorvastatin and sacubitril is mentioned in the us product package insert as a theoretical possibility . \\n there is currently no recommendation to increase monitoring or empirically decrease the dose of any statin on initiation of sacubitril / valsartan . \\n a number of medications are known to inhibit oatps and have been shown to increase statin plasma concentrations . \\n many single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) have been found within the slco1b1 and/or slco1b3 genes encoding oatp1b1 and oatp1b3 proteins , respectively , and were shown to effect the pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics of statins [ 12 , 13 ] . \\n the clinical consequences of the drug interactions may vary based on the genetic variation in oatp - encoding genes and inhibition of oatp function . \\n the slco1b1 * 1b haplotype appears to be associated with enhanced hepatic uptake and reduced plasma concentrations of oatp1b1 substrates . \\n discontinuation of the statin alone did not result in a decrease in the patient s lfts . \\n it was not until sacubitril / valsartan was also discontinued , and treatment for rhabdomyolysis was initiated , that the patient s symptoms began to improve and her ck and lfts returned to baseline . \\n this could be due to either a direct effect of sacubitril / valsartan or the increased serum concentration of atorvastatin , as described in the literature . \\n because of the above - stated pharmacodynamics , we believe that the more likely mechanism is the increased serum concentration of atorvastatin . currently , there is no recommendation regarding the initiation or continuation of statins in patients with nyha class ii \\n iv heart failure as there is insufficient information on which to base recommendations for or against statin treatment . in these patients , the choice of statin dose , and using a statin for cardiovascular risk reduction benefit , must be weighed against adverse effects , drug  drug interactions , precautions and contraindications to statin therapy . \\n we would have liked to have arranged slcob testing for the patient but were unable to . \\n further research will be useful in identifying patients at risk for this adverse reaction , and will likely include genetic testing . \\n this case of severe rhabdomyolysis should stimulate further investigation of the potential

pth ) is the most frequent complication of tonsillectomy , and occasionally results in a lethal outcome . \\n a 21-year - old man ( height 180 cm , weight 95 kg ) was scheduled for a bilateral tonsillectomy and uvulopalatopharyngoplasty for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea . \\n he required 5 rounds of general anesthesia due to recurrent pth . \\n the anesthesiologist used sugammadex a total of 3 times to achieve the successful reversal of the deep neuromuscular blockade ( nmb ) induced by rocuronium . \\n after sugammadex 2 mg / kg was administered , the nmb was reversed in 2 minutes each time . \\n re - administration of rocuronium within a short time interval after sugammadex may result in unpredictable effects of neuromuscular blocking agents . \\n sugammadex made it possible to perform a rapid , complete reverse when the residual block was maintained by an incomplete reversal of anticholinesterase .', 'human reproduction is a relatively inefficient process and therefore the number of infertile couples is high . \\n assisted reproductive technologies ( art ) have facilitated the birth of over five million children worldwide . \\n art , however , superimposes its own relative inefficiency on the preexisting inefficiency of normal reproduction . \\n the efficiency ( expressed as pregnancy rate ) is generally not more than 30% . \\n modern reproductive medicine is gradually moving from multiple embryo transfer to the transfer of a single embryo , mainly because of obvious and unwanted side effects of multiple embryo transfer ( e.g.  epidemic  multiple pregnancies ) . \\n this concept , however , requires a fast , professional selection of the most viable embryo during the first few days of art . \\n thus the aim of a modern art is the safe transfer of a healthy , viable , single embryo . \\n accurate and rapid methods of quantifying embryo viability are needed to reach this goal . \\n methodological advances have the potential to make an important contribution , and there has been a drive to develop alternative non - invasive methods to better meet clinical needs . \\n metabolic and genetic profiling of spent embryo culture ( sec )

into different categories according to their functions in leaf senescence or morphological phenotypes when mutated . \\n we made extensive annotations for these sags by both manual and computational approaches , and users can either browse or search the database to obtain information including literatures , mutants , phenotypes , expression profiles , mirna interactions , orthologs in other plants and cross links to other databases . \\n we have also integrated a bioinformatics analysis platform weblab into lsd , which allows users to perform extensive sequence analysis of their interested sags . \\n the sag sequences in lsd can also be downloaded readily for bulk analysis . \\n we believe that the lsd contains the largest number of sags to date and represents the most comprehensive and informative plant senescence - related database , which would facilitate the systems biology research and comparative studies on plant aging .', 'objective  individuals with type 1

community control subjects . \\n a1c , igf-1 , igf binding protein-3 , serum osteocalcin , and urine n - teleopeptide were measured at follow-up.resultsafter adjusting for age , bmi , and oral contraceptive use , bmd at year 2 continued to be lower in women 20 years of age with type 1 diabetes compared with control subjects at the total hip , femoral neck , and whole body . \\n lower bmd values were observed in cases < 20 years of age compared with control subjects ; however , the differences were not statistically significant . \\n lower bmd did not correlate with diabetes control , growth factors , or metabolic bone markers.conclusionsthis study confirms our previous findings that young women with type 1 diabetes have lower bmd than control subjects and that these differences persist over time , particularly in women 20 years of age . \\n persistence of low bmd as well as failure to accrue bone density after age 20 years may contribute to the increased incidence of

control study and environmental investigation were undertaken to identify the vehicle of infection and source of the outbreak. from may 2001 to august 2001, a total of 170 case - patients meeting the case definition were identified, and 235 matched controls were enrolled in the study. of these, 119 ( 70% ) agreed to participate and were enrolled, along with 235 matched control subjects. of the 119 case - participants, \\n the median age was 8 years ( range 4 months to 90 years ), and 57% were female ; the median duration of illness was 7 days ( range 144 days ) ; 17 ( 15% ) patients were hospitalized, and none died ; the most frequently reported symptoms were diarrhea ( 97% ) and abdominal pain ( 77% ), followed by fever ( 66% ). of those who had eaten raw eggs, four patients could identify the retail brand and outlet of purchase of six different brands of different brands from seven retail brands. \\n seven patients used roof - collected rainwater sources, and one used rainwater plus rainwater from a dam plus water from a rainwater - plus - rainwater source, and three patients consumed fast food from a fast food outlet. in the case - patient group, exposure to dead wild birds, consumption of fast food, and consumption of food at a large gathering, such as at a party or large barbecue, were also significantly associated with illness. in conclusion, the investigation successfully excluded a single common source exposure for this outbreak and instead suggested that multiple exposures contribute to human s. typhicimubertus dt161 infections in new zealan.\",\n          \"background : chlamydia trachomatis infection ( ct ) is one of the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infections ( stis ) in the developing world.objectives:the primary objective of this study was to establish the need for screening hiv seropositive women for cti.materials and methods : this prospective study was conducted at the hiv molecular laboratory of the integrated counseling and testing center ( ictc ) of the medical college of microbiology, lokok nak nayak hospital, new delhi, india between july 2010 and january 2011.results:the prevalence of ct in hiv-infected and hiv -
